> On the whole, biologists tend to treat the fisherman as an exogenous element in their analytical model, and the behavior of fishermen is not made into an integrated element of a general and systematic "bionomic" theory... the "overfishing problem" has its roots in the economic organization of the industry. 
- H. Scott Gordon, *The Economic Theory of a Common Property Resource: The Fishery*


Gordon's critique of the state of fisheries management in 1957 seems very relevant to the state of the physics and engineering literature on orbital debris modeling. There are extremely sophisticated mathematical and statistical models of the physics involved, but the farthest any paper in this literature I've seen go toward integrating the behavioral responses of orbit users to the state of the orbital environment is Bradley and Wein (2009)

Economists have increasingly become aware of the orbital debris problem, and the issues with orbital management more generally. A lot of the work I've seen so far in space economics concerning orbital debris has been in the "[law and economics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Law_and_economics)" tradition. A brief selection of some of the work in this vein: [Macauley (1998)](http://econpapers.repec.org/article/ucpjlawec/v_3a41_3ay_3a1998_3ai_3a2_3ap_3a737-64.htm) (a conceptual framework and a model to estimate welfare costs of non-market geostationary belt allocation procedures and potential gains from market procedures),[Senechal (2007)](http://dspace.mit.edu/handle/1721.1/39519) (what should we think about when drafting and negotiating an orbital debris convention), [Weeden and Chow (2012)](http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0265964612000604) (a framework for potential policies using Ostrom's principles for common-pool resources), [Salter (2015)](http://mercatus.org/sites/default/files/Salter-Space-Debris.pdf) (clarifying the difficulties and costs private and public actors must consider), and of course the excellent [Adilov, Alexander, and Cunningham (2015)](http://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10640-013-9758-4) (an economic model of earth orbit debris). 

Macauley (1998) stands out as the only mathematical economic model I've seen of supply and demand factors orbital use which includes electromagnetic spectrum use. Adilov, Alexander, and Cunningham (2015) stands out as the only mathematical economic model I've seen of satellite launch behavior and orbital debris generation. 

These models contribute to our understanding of the gaps between decentralized orbital and spectrum use without markets, with markets, and with an infeasible social planner, so that we have some sense of what we stand to gain by implementing orbital management institutions. The physical and engineering models describe what the physical constraints on such institutions are, and offer baseline values with which to calibrate and test economic models of specific use patterns.

This is all incredibly valuable.

Macauley (1998) is particularly notable to me for 2 reasons: (a) it was written in the 90s (the earliest draft I've seen is from 1994), before historically low launch costs and the space industry boom; (b) most of the current discussion I see of the economics of orbit focuses on orbital debris, but the evidently-less-sexy issues with spectrum use seem to attract considerable regulatory scrutiny.

Based on my studies in this area, I think there is still a need for a "Schaefer model of orbital management" - a dynamic economic model that characterizes the interaction between launchers' behavior and the physical constraints of orbital use (i.e., the orbital mechanics of the debris problem and the physics of electromagnetic spectrum use). Such a model would be generalizable to: (a) the many uses of orbits, from telecommunications to imaging to tourism; (b) the different orbits in use, from LEO regimes to the GEO belt; and would provide a valuable benchmark against which policies could be measured and designed.
