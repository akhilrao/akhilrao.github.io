Here I review Glyn Wittwer and Peter Dixon's (hereafter WD) 2011 paper, ["Water Trading, Buybacks and Drought in the Murray-Darling Basin: Lessons from Economic Modelling"](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/231609565_The_economic_impact_of_the_buyback_program?enrichId=rgreq-cdbad4ebb3a8e2d26b91b15830e80436-XXX&enrichSource=Y292ZXJQYWdlOzIzMTYwOTU2NTtBUzoxMDIxMDM2MTE2MDkwOTJAMTQwMTM1NDgwNjY0OQ%3D%3D&el=1_x_2). The paper was published as a chapter in a book titled, "Crisis and Opportunity: Lessons of Australian Water Reform". The version I linked to on ResearchGate is a draft version; I haven't yet read the book to see if there are any major differences in the published version.
