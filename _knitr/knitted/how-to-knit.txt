step 2: write up a post as a .Rmd
step 3: run it through knitr in Rstudio to make sure it works
step 4: make a folder in \public\images for the plots, if any
step 5: run the knitr-approved .Rmd file through KnitPost.r in Rstudio, setting the parameter post.pics.dir="folder made for the plots in step 4"
