        An app for Coase bargaining
      </a>
    </h1>

    <span class="post-date">10 May 2016</span>

    <p>I came across an article today about <a href="http://www.economist.com/blogs/buttonwood/2016/05/airline-safety?fsrc=scn%2Ftw%2Fte%2Fbl%2Fed%2F?fsrc=scn/fb/te/bl/ed/airlinesafetytenwaystotellyoumightbesittingnexttoaneconomist">&quot;how you know you&#39;re on a plane with an economist&quot;</a>. The article&#39;s supposed to be a take on another recent news piece, about an economist getting pulled off a plane for doing math. I have a long flight coming up, and the article got me thinking about the problem of people reclining.</p>

<p>The person sitting in front of me on a long (8+ hours) flight has the right to recline their seat back. Now, I&#39;m not a very tall person and I&#39;m used to sitting for long stretches, so I am not too physically uncomfortable if the person in front of me reclines all the way. But I do like to read, write, and occasionally eat, so the lack of space in front of me is not ideal.</p>

<p>(Some airlines get around this by having seats in a fixed bucket, so that instead of actually reclining you just kinda slide forward in the bucket. I really don&#39;t like these; I think they&#39;re the worst of both worlds. You no longer have much space, and you can&#39;t even meaningfully recline. I&#39;m ignoring this case here.)</p>

<p>The situation with the reclining seat seems like something the Coase theorem ought to apply to: we have a well-defined property right (person in front has right to recline) and an externality (reclining reduces my personal space), so maybe we can bargain our way to a better solution. This is such a straightforward idea, I&#39;m sure it&#39;s been discussed elsewhere at length.</p>

<p>What I would like is an app to facilitate this bargaining. I think the app would do something like this:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Given two participating users, allow the users to define the property right and the externality in question. For example, &quot;<Person \\(A\\)> has <the right to recline>, <person \\(B\\)> is negatively affected by <reclining> and would like to see if a welfare-improving bargain can be struck.&quot; (Suppose \(B\) is &quot;she&quot; and \(A\) is &quot;he&quot; for exposition.)</p></li>
<li><p>Users privately enter their maximum willingness-to-pay and minimum willingness-to-accept to reduce the externality. In the seat example, \(A\) would enter his minimum willingness-to-accept to not recline, and \(B\) would enter her maximum willingness-to-pay for \(A\) to not recline.</p></li>
<li><p>If the maximum WTP is greater than or equal to the minimum WTA, the app would suggest a price for \(B\) to pay \(A\) to not recline. The specific price can be determined by some &quot;fair&quot; division, like the Nash Bargaining Solution.</p></li>
</ol>

<p>In the example above, the Nash Bargaining Solution would be a payment \(p_B\) from \(B\) to \(A\) that solves</p>

<p>$$ \max_{p_B} \ (p_B - WTA_A)(WTP_B - p_B) $$</p>

<p>where \( WTA_A \) and \( WTP_B \) are \(A\) and \(B\)&#39;s minimum willingness-to-accept and maximum willingness-to-pay, respectively. The solution is</p>

<p>$$ p_B = \frac{WTP_B + WTA_A}{2} $$</p>

<p>i.e., with the NBS, if \( WTP_B \geq WTA_A \), \(B\) would pay \(A\) his minimum willingness-to-accept to not recline, plus half of her excess willingness-to-pay for \(A\) to not recline. This results in the surplus, \( WTP_B - WTA_A \), being evenly divided between \(A\) and \(B\).</p>

<p>The usual problem people cite with the Coase theorem in practice is that it gets hard to implement with more than a few people. It seems to me like a phone app could really make these transactions easier to do. I&#39;ve described the two-person case above, but I reckon this could be extended to the \(n\)-person case using the Shapley value. I would be willing to pay $5 for an app that did this, possibly more if it was widely used.</p>

        Is this worth a search?
      </a>
    </h1>

    <span class="post-date">08 Feb 2016</span>

    <p>Another simple Shiny app, this time to answer the question, <a href="https://akhilrao.shinyapps.io/worthASearchApp/">&quot;is this worth searching for?&quot;</a>. </p>

<p>The basic idea is taken from this <a href="http://akhilrao.github.io/micro%20theory/2015/10/08/imperfect-information-car-search.html">earlier post</a> about searching for a used car.</p>

<p>For example: Suppose you are thinking about looking for a used car, and you want to see whether it&#39;s worth searching for. You plug in your willingness-to-pay for a car, the cost to you to find and inspect one car, the number of sellers in the region, and the average price they&#39;re asking for. Using the formulas from the post for the expected quality of the average seller and the expected value of one search, we have</p>

<p>$$\begin{align}
\hat{\beta} &amp;= \frac{\beta}{N} \left( \frac{1- \beta^N}{1- \beta } \right) \cr
EV(\text{search}) &amp;= \hat{\beta}(v-p) - c
\end{align}$$</p>

<p>where \(N\) is the number of sellers, \(\beta\) is the probability the average seller has what you want, \(p\) is the average price, and \(c\) is the search cost. If the expected value of a search is greater than 0, it&#39;s worth at least one search.</p>

<p>Using the app, I can see what the probability of a seller having what I want would need to be for a search to be worth it. I can interpret the point on the x axis where \(EV(\text{search})=0\) as the minimum level of belief I would have to hold that the average seller has what I&#39;m looking for for a search to be rational.</p>

        A conditional probability app
      </a>
    </h1>

    <span class="post-date">07 Feb 2016</span>

    <p>I wrote my first-ever Shiny app! My first-ever app, too. It&#39;s a simple <a href="https://akhilrao.shinyapps.io/conditionalProbApp/">conditional probability calculator</a>. </p>

<p>Say you have two events, \(A\) and \(B\), which occur over two populations \(N_A\) and \(N_B\). Input the number of occurrences of \(A\) and \(B\) and the size of \(N_A\) and \(N_B\), and the app will apply Bayes&#39; rule to show you \(P(A|B)\) for beliefs you may hold over \(P(B|A)\).</p>

<p>For example: Suppose you want to know the probability that someone who died in the USA in 2010 was 85+ years old. Event A is taken to be the number of deaths in the USA in 2010, event B is taken to be the population that was 85+ years old in the USA in 2010, and the population size is taken to be the average total population of the USA in 2010 (\(N_A = N_B\)). Three Wolfram Alpha queries later we have</p>

<p>$$\begin{align}
P(A) &amp;= \frac{2,550,000}{310,000,000} = 0.008 \cr
P(B) &amp;= \frac{5,176,00}{310,000,000} = 0.017
\end{align}$$</p>

<p>By Bayes&#39; rule, we have</p>

<p>$$ P(A|B) = P(B|A) \frac{P(A)}{P(B)} $$</p>

<p>I think \( P(A)/P(B) \) is called the base rate. </p>

<p>Using the app, I can see how the probability someone died given they were 85 or older would change depending on the probability of being 85 or older given they died (in the USA in 2010), or \(P(\text{died in USA in 2010|85 or older in USA in 2010})\) as a function of my beliefs over \(P(\text{85 or older in USA in 2010|died in USA in 2010})\). In frequency terms, I can calculate the proportion of deaths that were 85+ year olds using the number of 85+ year olds, the number of deaths, the total US population in 2010, and my beliefs over the proportion of 85 year olds who died. I used this example as a &quot;comparison event&quot; for the app.</p>

<p>In the picture below, the red line is \(P(\text{died in USA in 2010|85 or older in USA in 2010})\), and the black line is \(P(A|B)\) for a hypothetical event where \(P(A) = 15/100\) and \(P(B) = 50/100\).</p>

<p><a href="/public/images/conditionalProbApp/stock.png" title="Example"><img src="/public/images/conditionalProbApp/stock.png" alt="Example" title="Example"></a></p>

<p>I wrote this app to help me think through conditional probabilities more clearly. Often I hold beliefs over some \(P(B|A)\) and use those beliefs to infer something about the corresponding \(P(A|B)\), not necessarily considering the base rate. Hopefully I&#39;ll neglect base rates a little less going forward.</p>

        Proof of a law of large numbers
      </a>
    </h1>

    <span class="post-date">16 Nov 2015</span>

    <p>Usually, when we have a sequence of random variables, we can say things about what the average of the sequence does as the sample grows by assuming things about the moments and the sampling process and then applying an appropriate law of large numbers. But how would we prove a law of large numbers?</p>

<p>Laws of large numbers are statements about averages of random variables converging in probability to a constant. In this example, we assume the existence of a finite first moment, assume random sampling with replacement (IID), and show that a sequence of averages of the IID random variables will converge to the first moment.</p>

<p>Let \( \{X_t\}, ~ t=1,2,... \) be the sequence of IID random variables on a probability space \( ( \Omega, \mathcal{F}, P ) \) with \( E(X_t) = \mu \lt \infty \). The goal is to show that </p>

<p>$$ \lim_{n \to \infty} P \left( \omega : \left| \frac{1}{n} \sum_{t=1}^n X_t(\omega) - \mu \right| \gt \epsilon \right) = 0 $$</p>

<h3 id="proof">Proof</h3>

<p>Begin by defining \( A_n \) and its characteristic function:</p>

<p>$$\begin{align}
A_n &amp; \equiv \frac{1}{n} \sum_{t=1}^n X_t \cr
\phi_{A_n}(s) &amp; \equiv E(e^{isA_n }) \cr
&amp; = \int e^{isA_n } ~ dP \cr
\end{align}$$</p>

<p>By the properties of exponential functions and the fact that \( X_t \) is IID, we can write \( \phi_{A_n}(s) \) as</p>

<p>$$ \phi_{A_n}(s) =  ( \phi_{X_t} \left( \frac{s}{n} \right) )^n $$</p>

<p>By a theorem I may someday prove here but will now state without proof (Carlos&#39; Theorem 129), we can approximate \( \phi_{X_t}(\frac{s}{n}) \) as</p>

<p>$$\begin{align}
 \phi_{X_t} \left(\frac{s}{n} \right) &amp; = 1 + is \frac{E(X_t)}{n} + \mathcal{O} \left(\frac{s^2}{n^2} \right) \cr
 &amp; = 1 + is \frac{ \mu }{n} + \mathcal{O} \left(\frac{s^2}{n^2} \right) \cr
 \mathcal{O} \left(\frac{s^2}{n^2} \right) &amp; \equiv i^2 \int_0^{\frac{x}{n}} \left(\frac{x}{n}-s \right) e^{is} ds \cr
\end{align}$$</p>

<p>\( \mathcal{O}(\frac{s^2}{n^2}) \) is the remainder from the approximation, the \( \mathcal{O} \) is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_O_notation">big O notation</a> that the remainder is bounded.</p>

<p>So now we have</p>

<p>$$ \phi_{A_n}(s) \approx \left( 1 + is \frac{\mu}{n} \right)^n $$</p>

<p>The trick is to use a binomial expansion here. In general,</p>

<p>$$ \begin{align}
\left( 1+ \frac{a}{n} \right)^n &amp; = \sum_{j=0}^n \binom{n}{j} \left( \frac{a}{n} \right)^j \cr
\lim_{n \to \infty} \left( 1+ \frac{a}{n} \right)^n &amp; = \sum_{j=0}^{\infty} \left( \frac{a^j}{j!} \right) \cr
&amp; = e^a \cr
\end{align} $$</p>

<p>So, letting \( a = is \mu \),</p>

<p>$$\begin{align}
\phi_{A_n}(s) &amp; = \left( 1 + is \frac{ \mu }{n} + \mathcal{O}(\frac{s^2}{n^2}) \right)^n \cr
 \lim_{n \to \infty} \phi_{A_n}(s) &amp; = e^{is \mu } = \phi_{ \mu } (s) \cr
\end{align}$$</p>

<p>The remainder term \( \mathcal{O} (\frac{s^2}{n^2} ) \to 0 \) as \(n \to \infty\).</p>

<p>By the uniqueness of mapping between characteristic and distribution functions of random variables, \( \lim_{n \to \infty} \phi_{A_n}(s) = \phi_{ \mu }(s) \) implies \( \lim_{n \to \infty} F_{A_n} = F_{ \mu } \), where \( F_{A_n} \) and \( F_{ \mu } \) are the distribution functions of \( A_n \) and \( \mu \) respectively.</p>

<p>This is still only convergence in distribution, not convergence in probability. However, \( \mu \) is a constant, and convergence in distribution to the distribution of a constant is the same as convergence in probability to that constant (think of the constant&#39;s distribution as a point mass). So we have the desired result, \( A_n \overset{p}{\to} \mu \).</p>

<h3 id="discussion">Discussion</h3>

<p>I&#39;m not entirely sure how to interpret the parameter \(s\) for a general characteristic function. The characteristic function is just an exponential Fourier transform, and I would usually interpret that parameter as the &quot;time index&quot; for a given sequence I was Fourier transforming. I&#39;m not sure if that interperetation is justified here, since each random variable is an IID draw from the same distribution. If I wanted to read a &quot;time index&quot; into this, it would be \( t\), which is the draw number. Maybe \(s\) is not very meaningful in this setting, so we can let it be whatever we want?</p>

<p>Anyway, the point of doing it this way is that sometimes a product of exponentials is easier to work with than some arbitrary sum. I should learn more about Fourier transforms and characteristic functions, they seem useful.</p>

        An example of a two-part tariff

    <p>What if a monopolist could design a pricing scheme to capture more consumer surplus when consumers have different valuations of the product? This is the idea behind price discrimination. A two-part tariff is a way to implement price discrimination when the seller is uncertain about the individual consumer&#39;s valuation.</p>

<p>In a two-part tariff, the seller prices the good as \(T(q) = A + pq \). This creates a continuum of bundles, \( \{T,q\} \), located on a straight line. In choosing a quantity, the consumer chooses a bundle along this line, and in any bundle, the consumer pays at least \(A\).</p>

<p>Two-part tariffs can only work if there is limited arbitrage. It doesn&#39;t work if a consumer can just acquire the good and re-sell it at \(A\). An amusement park that charges an admission price and a price per ride (a time cost?) is an example. This pricing scheme is a de facto quantity discount, since the average cost goes down as the quantity purchased increases.</p>

<h2 id="an-example">An example</h2>

<p>Suppose consumer preferences follow </p>

<p>$$ \begin{align}
 U_i = \begin{cases}
    \theta_i V(q_i) - T(q_i) \ &amp;&amp; \text{if} \ q_i \gt 0 \cr
    0 \ &amp;&amp; \text{if} \ q_i = 0 \cr
\end{cases} 
\end{align}$$</p>

<p>where \(V : ~ V(0) = 0, V&#39;(q_i) \gt 0, V&#39;&#39;(q_i) \lt 0 \). \( \theta_i \) is the &quot;taste&quot; parameter that varies across consumers.</p>

<p>Assume there are two groups of consumers: a proportion \( \lambda \) have \( \theta = \theta_1 \), and \( 1- \lambda \) have \( \theta = \theta_2 \), where \( \theta_2 \gt \theta_1 \gt c \), where \( c \) is the seller&#39;s marginal cost.</p>

<p>A convenient functional form that satisfies this is \(V(q) = \frac{1}{2}(1-(1-q)^2 ) \), so that \( V&#39;(q) = 1-q \). This lets us derive consumer demand, aggregate demand, and net consumer surplus. To get consumer demand, we solve</p>

<p>$$ \max_{q_i} \  \theta_i V(q_i) - T(q_i) $$</p>

<p>which gives us</p>

<p>$$ \begin{align}
q_i &amp; = 1 - \frac{p}{ \theta_i } \cr
Q(p) &amp; = 1 - p \hat{ \theta } \cr
CS_i &amp; = \frac{1}{2 \theta_i } ( \theta_i - p)^2 \cr
\end{align} $$</p>

<p>where \( \hat{ \theta } = \frac{\lambda}{\theta_1} + \frac{1- \lambda}{\theta_2} \), the harmonic mean of the two groups&#39; valuations.</p>

<h3 id="fully-observable-theta_i">Fully observable \( \theta_i \)</h3>

<p>When the monopolist can fully observe \( \theta_i \), the best they can do is to set \(p=c\) (maximize the size of the pie) and then charge each group their total surplus for the purchase, \(A_i=CS_i = \frac{1}{2 \theta_i } ( \theta_i - c)^2 \) (perfect price discrimination). The personalized fixed fee will be higher for the type with the higher valuation.</p>

<p>The monopolist&#39;s profit under this pricing scheme is</p>

<p>$$ \pi^{pd} = \lambda \frac{1}{2 \theta_1}( \theta_1 - c)^2 + ( 1 - \lambda ) \frac{1}{2 \theta_2}( \theta_2 - c)^2 $$</p>

<p>If the monopolist couldn&#39;t observe \( \theta_i \), they couldn&#39;t implement this scheme, as \( \theta_2 \) would have an incentive to pretend to be \( \theta_1 \).</p>

<h3 id="unobservable-theta_i">Unobservable \( \theta_i \)</h3>

<p>When \( \theta_i \) is unobservable to the monopolist, the best they can do with a linear tariff is to charge the monopoly price.</p>

<p>An alternate interpretation is that the monopolist is still able to observe \( \theta_i \), but that consumers can fully arbitrage the good so that the monopolist is limited to linear tariffs.</p>

<p>Whatever the interpretation, in this case we solve the standard monopoly pricing problem with \( Q(p) = 1 - p \hat{ \theta } \). The price is \( p^m = \frac{1}{2}( \hat{\theta } + c) \) and the profits are \( \pi^m = \frac{1}{4 \hat{\theta } }( \hat{\theta } - c )^2 \).</p>

<p>We assume that \( \theta_1 \gt \frac{1}{2}(c+ \theta_2 ) \) , so that the monopolist finds it profitable to serve both populations.</p>

<h3 id="linear-two-part-tariff">Linear two-part tariff</h3>

<p>When \( \theta_i \) is unobservable to the seller, they can do better than monopoly pricing by using a linear two-part tariff that captures all of the lower-valuation-type&#39;s surplus.</p>

<p>Suppose that the marginal price is \( p \). The highest fixed fee under which \( \theta_1 \) will still purchase is \( A = CS_1 (p) \). \( \theta_2 \) will buy under this scheme, because \( CS_2(p) \gt CS_1(p) = A \). So the monopolist solves</p>

<p>$$ \begin{align} 
\max_p \ &amp; CS_1(p) + (p-c)Q(p) \cr
  = &amp; \frac{1}{2 \theta_1}(\theta_1 -p)^2 + (p-c)(\hat{\theta} -p) \cr
  \implies p = &amp; \frac{ \hat{\theta} + c - 1 }{2- \theta_{1}^{-1}}
\end{align} $$</p>

<h3 id="comparison">Comparison</h3>

<p>In the above pricing schemes,</p>

<p>$$ \begin{align}
c = &amp; p^{pd} \lt p^{2t} \lt p^m \cr
 &amp; \pi^{pd} \gt \pi^{2t} \gt \pi^m \cr<br>
\end{align} $$</p>

<p>Under perfect price discrimination, the monopolist charges a personalized fixed fee \( A_i = \frac{1}{2 \theta_i } ( \theta_i - c)^2 \) and captures all of the surplus. Thus, the profits in this case are the highest.</p>

<p>Under the linear two-part tariff, the monopolist charges a blanket fixed fee equal to the lower type&#39;s surplus, \( A = \frac{1}{2 \theta_1 } ( \theta_1 - c)^2 \). In a more general setting with a continuum of types, this would be the surplus of the lowest type the monopolist finds it worthwhile to go after.</p>

<p>Under the monopoly price, the monopolist doesn&#39;t try to capture any additional surplus based on consumer&#39;s valuations. Consequently, the profits are lowest, and the price is the highest. The higher price creates more deadweight loss, but since the monopolist doesn&#39;t have any instrument to capture the lost surplus this doesn&#39;t matter to them.</p>

<p>In terms of total welfare, surplus is maximized under perfect price discrimination, and is higher under the two-part tariff than under monopoly pricing. This increase in total surplus comes at a cost to the consumer, as the monopolist is able to capture all of the low type&#39;s surplus with the two-part tariff. This gives the monopolist an incentive to reduce the deadweight loss associated with monopoly pricing by reducing the marginal price. Under perfect price discrimination the total surplus is maximized, but all of it goes to the producer.</p>

<p>This suggests that price discrimination may be desirable in some markets to the extent that the benefits of the efficiency gains compensate consumers for their loss in surplus. I think it would be interesting to try to model this with a bargaining layer, where consumers could bargain with the firm over the surplus. I think it could be similar to the <a href="http://akhilrao.github.io/micro%20theory/2015/11/01/nash-bargaining-example/">Nash Bargaining example</a>.</p>

<p>In real life, I don&#39;t know if we often observe many examples of transfer payments from firms to consumers that would indicate some sort of bargaining over price discrimination. I think that the Second Welfare Theorem may imply it&#39;s possible, in which case the Coase Theorem would imply that if it&#39;s welfare-increasing for both parties we should see it happen. So there may be some examples out there.</p>
