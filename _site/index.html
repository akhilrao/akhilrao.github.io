        Hotelling duopoly with different valuations and a merger
      </a>
    </h1>

    <span class="post-date">01 Oct 2015</span>

    <p>Consider a Hotelling duopoly on opposite ends of a linear city. <a href="http://akhilrao.github.io/micro%20theory/2015/09/28/hotelling-triangle-city/">We know</a> that if the firms and products are symmetric, the indifferent consumer is at the midpoint and the price is greater than marginal cost by the travel cost (\(\tilde{x}=\frac{1}{2}, p=t+c\)). Suppose the firms are symmetric with constant marginal cost \(c\), but consumers value their products at \(v_1\) and \(v_2\), respectively. Assume that \(v_1\) and \(v_2\) are high enough that the market will be covered, and that the firms choose prices simultaneously. As before, we first find the indifferent consumer&#39;s demand and then plug it into the firms&#39; profit-maximizations.</p>

<p>The indifferent consumer&#39;s demand:</p>

<p>$$ \begin{align}
&amp; v_1 - p_1 - t\tilde{x} = v_2 - p_2 - t(1-\tilde{x}) \cr
\cr
\implies &amp; \tilde{x} = \frac{(v_1-v_2)-(p_1-p_2)}{2t} + \frac{1}{2} \cr
\end{align} $$</p>

<p>The firms&#39; first-order conditions and optimal prices:</p>

<p>$$ \begin{align}
\text{Firm 1:} &amp; \ \ \frac{1}{2}[1 + \frac{(v_1-v_2)-(2p_1-p_2)-c}{t}] = 0 \cr
\text{Firm 2:} &amp; \ \ \frac{1}{2}[1 + \frac{(v_1-v_2)-(p_1-2p_2)-c}{t}] = 0 \cr \cr
p_1 &amp; = \frac{1}{2}[v_1-v_2+p_2^* + \frac{t}{2} + c] \cr
p_2 &amp; = \frac{1}{2}[v_2-v_1+p_1^* + \frac{t}{2} + c] \cr
\end{align} $$</p>

<p>As we&#39;d expect, each firm&#39;s optimal price is increasing in consumers&#39; valuations of their own product, decreasing in consumers&#39; valuations of their competitor&#39;s product, and increasing in their marginal cost. Interestingly, their own optimal prices are increasing in their competitor&#39;s price.</p>

<p>In Cournot models, if the other firm increases their quantity, you want to decrease yours - we see this from the Cournot best-response, \( q_i^* = \frac{-(p(Q) - c)}{\frac{\partial p}{\partial Q}} \) (which is \(q_i^* = \frac{a - bq_j^* - c}{2b} \) when inverse demand is linear), where \(\frac{\partial q_i}{\partial q_j} \lt 0\). The quantities are &quot;strategic substitutes&quot;. This linkage is through the inverse demand function, where one firm increasing its quantity results in a lower price for all firms.</p>

<p>In Hotelling models the opposite is true regarding prices - they are &quot;strategic complements&quot;, or \(\frac{\partial p_i}{\partial p_j} \gt 0\). My intuition for this is that the other firm raising its price gives you room to raise yours; as long as we assume the market is covered, there is a single indifferent consumer choosing between the two firms who links their prices in this way. If the market isn&#39;t covered, I think you would have two indifferent consumers, one for each firm, each consumer indifferent between buying from the nearer firm or not buying at all. Then the firms&#39; problems would be decoupled, and \(\frac{\partial p_i}{\partial p_j}\) would be 0.</p>

<p>How much would a change in cost affect the price? We can see this by looking at \(\frac{\partial p_i}{\partial c}\) for any \(i\). This is called the &quot;pass-through rate&quot;, or just the &quot;pass-through&quot;. In a future post, I&#39;ll derive the pass-through rate for a Cournot oligopolist and relate it to the curvature of the inverse demand function. Here, the pass-through is easy: \(\frac{\partial p_i}{\partial c} = \frac{1}{2}\).</p>

<p>What if the firms merged and became a monopolist selling two differentiated products? In this case, the firm can capture all of the consumer surplus. The indifferent consumer&#39;s demand becomes:</p>

<p>$$ \begin{align}
&amp; v_1 - p_1 - t\tilde{x} = v_2 - p_2 - t(1-\tilde{x}) = 0 \cr \cr
\implies &amp; \tilde{x} = \frac{(v_1-p_1)}{t}, \cr
 &amp; \tilde{x} = \frac{v_2-p_2}{t} + 1 \cr
\end{align} $$</p>

<p>We can use the two expressions we have for \(\tilde{x}\) to get a function that relates \(p_1\) to \(p_2\). I&#39;m going to go with \(p_2 = p_1 - v_1 + v_2 + t \). Now we solve the firm&#39;s problem and get the prices:</p>

<p>$$ \begin{align}
&amp; \max_{p_1} \ [p_1 + p_2(p_1) - c]\tilde{x}(p_1) \cr
\implies &amp; p_1 = \frac{1}{4}[3v_1 - v_2 + t + c] \cr
\implies &amp; p_2 = \frac{1}{4}[5v_2 - v_1 + 5t + c] \cr
\end{align} $$</p>

<p>\(p_1\) and \(p_2\) look a little weird to me, with the fractions and numbers, but I double-checked my algebra and I think it&#39;s right. Anyway, the signs on the derivatives make sense. As the indifferent consumer&#39;s valuation of product 1 increases (decreases), the price of product 2 decreases (increases), and vice versa. The price is increasing in travel and marginal costs.</p>

<p>I like the addition of the firms merging. I&#39;d like to look at some more models with that.</p>

<p>Variations to explore:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>A merger between two firms in Triangle City</p></li>
<li><p>A model of Circle City with \(n\) firms</p></li>
<li><p>A merger between two firms in an \(n\)-firm Circle City</p></li>
<li><p>A Hotelling model on a not-fully-connected graph? Consumers and firms would be at the nodes, with the cost of reaching a firm increasing in the number of nodes between a consumer and the firm. I think it would be a lot harder to solve than a Hotelling model on a continuous space, but the linkages in price through demand would be interesting. Maybe a continuous city on a polygon with lines between vertices is an easier way to look at those linkages.</p></li>
</ul>

        Asymmetric Cournot with discrete quantities
      </a>
    </h1>

    <span class="post-date">30 Sep 2015</span>

    <p>In standard Cournot models, firms are symmetric and choose continuous quantities (\(q_i \in \mathbb{R_+}\)). Here we consider a model of Cournot duopoly with asymmetric firms limited to discrete quantities (\(q_i \in \mathbb{Z_+}\)). Because the set we are optimizing over is no longer continuous, we can&#39;t use the Kuhn-Tucker approach used in Cournot models with continuous quantities. Instead, we set up the problem as a game in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Normal-form_game">normal form</a> and find the pure- and mixed-strategy Nash equilibria by using <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strategic_dominance">iterated elimination of dominated strategies</a>.</p>

<h3 id="the-setting">The setting</h3>

<p>Let firm 1 have marginal cost \(c_1 = 4\) and firm 2 have marginal cost \(c_2 = 5\). Let the inverse demand function be given by 
$$ \begin{align}
P(Q)=\begin{cases} 10 - Q \ \ &amp; if \ \ Q \le 10 \cr 
0 \ \ &amp; if \ \ Q \gt 10 \end{cases} 
\end{align} $$</p>

<p>and \( Q = q_1 + q_2\).</p>

<p>To start, we can eliminate any quantities greater than the firm&#39;s monopoly quantities. That&#39;s what the firm would do if it wasn&#39;t constrained by its competitor, so it can&#39;t be profit-maximizing to play anything above those quantities. To find the monopoly quantities, we can take the standard Cournot duopoly best-response function, \(q_i^* = \frac{a - bq_j^* - c_i}{2b}\), and plug in \( q_j^* = 0\). This gives us that firm 1&#39;s monopoly quantity is 3, and firm 2&#39;s is 2.5. We can eliminate any quantity choice greater than 3 for both firms, since they are strictly dominated.</p>

<p>How do we handle 2.5? Firm 2 has to choose 2 or 3, not 2.5. We can see that \(\pi_2(q_1=0,q_2=3) = 6\) and \(\pi_2(q_1=0,q_2=2) = 6 \), so we can&#39;t eliminate 3 from firm 2&#39;s choices by strict domination.</p>

        When tutors signal quality to students by higher prices

    </h1>

    <span class="post-date">30 Sep 2015</span>

    <p>Why do economics tutors who charge higher prices seem to get more students? Signalling may explain this if price is interpreted as a signal of quality. Such signalling may be an equilibrium outcome if students do not share information about tutor quality.</p>

        When a manager can reduce fixed costs in exchange for profits
      </a>
    </h1>

    <span class="post-date">30 Sep 2015</span>

    <p>In most consumer-firm problems, we assume the consumer owns the firm, but doesn&#39;t manage it. Who does? It&#39;s not quite clear. I like to imagine that the firm is a robot that the consumer programmed to produce stuff and <em>whirr</em> MAXIMIZE PROFITS <em>whirr</em>. This model came from thinking about scenarios where a profit-maximizing owner who is perfectly capable of maximizing profits might want to hire a manager in exchange for a share of profits. Why would they do this? When would there be agency problems?</p>

<h3 id="the-setting">The setting</h3>

<p>The underlying problem is a profit-maximizing monopolist facing linear inverse demand \(p=a-bx\) and some positive fixed cost \(F\). That is,</p>

<p>$$\max_{x}  (p - c)x - F $$</p>

<p>I&#39;m framing it as a Cournot problem, but we could do it as a Bertrand problem and we&#39;d get the same result because there&#39;s only one firm. The fixed cost goes away and we get the familiar \(x^*=\frac{a-c}{2b}\) and \(p^*=\frac{a+c}{2}\).</p>

<p>The twist is that the fixed cost is \(F(k) = d - k\), where \(d\) is some positive number and \(k\in[0,1]\) is the share of profits the owner will give to a manager who can reduce the fixed costs. (The point wasn&#39;t to be super realistic, I just wanted something simple and decreasing in \(k\).)</p>

<p>The new problems are</p>

<p>$$ \begin{align}
\text{Manager:}&amp; \ \max_{x}  k[(p(x) - c)x - F] \cr
\text{Owner:} &amp; \  \max_{k} k[(p^* - c)x^* - F(k)] \cr
 &amp; s.t. \ k \ge 0 , 1-k \ge 0
\end{align} $$</p>

<p>The owner first decides how much to pay the manager. The more the owner pays the manager, the lower the fixed costs (I was going for &quot;more pay =&gt; better manager&quot;). Once this is decided, the manager steps in to maximize profits. I assume that reducing the fixed costs comes naturally to the manager  - it is costless to them - so \(F\) will drop out of the manager&#39;s first-order conditions just like it does for a regular problem with fixed costs.</p>

<h3 id="the-solution">The solution</h3>

<p>The manager&#39;s problem is a standard Cournot monopolist&#39;s problem. The profit-share, \(k\), is irrelevant to the optimal quantity choice because it enters the manager&#39;s problem as a constant scaling the profits.</p>

<p>$$ \begin{align}
\text{Manager&#39;s FOC:} \ &amp; k[p(x) + x\frac{\partial p}{\partial x} - c] = 0 \cr
\implies &amp; x^* = \frac{a-c}{2b}, \cr
&amp; p^* = \frac{a+c}{2}
\end{align} $$</p>

<p>The owner&#39;s problem is a little trickier because of the restrictions on \(k\). We need to set up the following Lagrangian:</p>

<p>$$ L = (1-k)[(p^* - c)x^* - d + k] + \lambda_1(k) + \lambda_2(1-k)$$</p>

<p>Which yields the following saddle-point conditions:</p>

<p>$$ \begin{align}
\mathsf{k:} &amp; \ -[(p^* - c)x^* - d + 2k] + \lambda_1 - \lambda_2 = 0 \cr
\mathsf{\lambda_1 :} &amp; \ \lambda_1(k) = 0 \cr
\mathsf{\lambda_2 :} &amp; \ \lambda_2(1-k) = 0 \cr
\end{align} $$</p>

<p>This gives us 3 cases which fully characterize the parameter space.</p>

<h5 id="case-1-k-0">Case 1: k = 0</h5>

<p>If we assume \(k=0\), we get the following saddle point:</p>

<p>$$ (k,\lambda_1,\lambda_2) = (0,\frac{(a-c)^2}{4b} - d,0) $$</p>

<p>The owner gives the manager nothing. The lagrange multipliers have to be non-negative, which gives us the parameter restriction: \( d \le \frac{(a-c)^2}{4b} \).</p>

<h5 id="case-2-k-in-0-1">Case 2: k \(\in\) (0,1)</h5>

<p>If we assume \(k \in (0,1)\), we get the following saddle point:</p>

<p>$$ (k,\lambda_1,\lambda_2) = (\frac{1}{2}(d - \frac{(a-c)^2}{4b}),0,0) $$</p>

<p>The owner gives the manager some positive share and the lagrange multipliers are 0. \(k \gt 0\) gives us the following parameter restriction: \( d \gt \frac{(a-c)^2}{4b} \).</p>

<h5 id="case-3-k-1">Case 3: k = 1</h5>

<p>If we assume \(k=1\), we get the following saddle point:</p>

<p>$$ (k,\lambda_1,\lambda_2) = (0,0,d - \frac{(a-c)^2 + 8b}{4b}) $$</p>

<p>The owner gives the manager full control of the company. \(\lambda_2 \ge 0\) gives us the following parameter restriction: \( d \ge \frac{(a-c)^2 + 8b}{4b} \).</p>

<h3 id="summary">Summary</h3>

<p>The owner and manager both will implement monopoly pricing - there&#39;s only one firm, so this is optimal. If the fixed cost without a manager is greater than the monopoly profit, then the owner will hire the manager to reduce the fixed cost. The owner will pay the manager half the difference between the original fixed cost and the monopoly profit - this is the owner&#39;s profit-maximizing wage for the manager. If the fixed cost is high enough, the owner will give the manager the company because the business isn&#39;t worth it.</p>

<p>Given the relationship between the wage paid to the manager and the fixed cost in this model, we can think of \(k\) not only as the profit-maximizing wage paid to the manager, but also as the optimal level of managerial ability that the owner will choose when it costs profit share.</p>

<p>What could this be a model of? I don&#39;t know. There&#39;s a manager who can make it worthwhile to get into a market where you&#39;ll be a monopolist if you can cross the high fixed cost to entry. Maybe a manager who has connections or knowledge that would reduce the fixed costs?</p>

<p>I think the agency problem involved in non-owners running a firm (so any professional management) is interesting. Eventually, I&#39;d like to construct a model where rational actors cause an agency problem. In this model, the manager does their job (picking the profit-maximizing business decision) perfectly. There is no agency problem because the manager is paid a fraction of profits, so the manager&#39;s wage-maximizing outcome is aligned with the owner&#39;s profit-maximizing desires. The manager is a price-taker in the sense that they simply take the share they are offered as given. This is reasonable if the market for managers is perfectly competitive.</p>

<p>Variations to explore:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>What if the manager was paid a share of sales or revenue instead of profits? I&#39;d expect agency problems to be possible here, since the objective functions don&#39;t necessarily align.</p></li>
<li><p>What if the manager could reduce marginal costs instead of fixed costs? I think of this as a manager who brings persistent efficiencies, whereas this one brings one-time efficiencies. I&#39;d expect qualitatively similar results to this model.</p></li>
<li><p>What if the firm was taxed (increasing in output) and the manager could reduce the tax? Again I&#39;d expect qualitatively similar results to this model, but it seems like a more plausible model for hiring managers with government connections.</p></li>
<li><p>O.E. Williamson, in his paper &quot;A Model of Rational Managerial Behavior&quot;, describes a pretty cool model with staffing and reported profits. It&#39;s more complicated than this one, and mentioning it in the &quot;Variations&quot; section is like calling a supercar a &quot;variation&quot; of a model T. I may blog about this one in the near future.</p></li>
