        Repeated play and collusion in an N-firm Bertrand oligopoly
      </a>
    </h1>

    <span class="post-date">02 Oct 2015</span>

    <p>So far, <a href="http://akhilrao.github.io/micro%20theory/2015/09/29/bertrand-cournot-oligopoly/">we&#39;ve seen</a> one-shot Bertrand games with up to \(N\) firms. What happens if the firms are playing a repeated Bertrand game? Does it matter if there are finitely many or infinitely many periods?</p>

<p>Consider a repeated Bertrand oligopoly with \(N \ge 2\) firms, played for \(T \lt \infty\) periods. We know that the one-shot Nash equilibrium is \(p_{i}=c \ \ \ \forall i \). For \(T\) periods, we use backwards induction: we start at the last period and work backwards.</p>

<p>In the last period, the game is a one-shot Bertrand game. Thus the equilibrium price will be \(p_{i,t}=c \ \ \ \forall i\). Each firm knows that in period \(T-1\), and  since there&#39;s no possibility of colluding tomorrow they each play \(p_{i,t-1}=c\). We can extend the argument to see that \(p_{i,t}=c \ \ \ \forall t,i\).</p>

<p>What if \(T = \infty\)? If the game is infinitely repeated, we can&#39;t apply backwards induction since there is no last period. Instead, we define trigger strategies and look for parameter restrictions that would need to hold to make the strategy a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subgame_perfect_equilibrium">subgame-perfect Nash equilibrium</a>. </p>

<p>Let&#39;s take the same example, and assume that play is history-dependent, i.e. players consider what happened before in deciding what to do today. We&#39;ll consider 3 cases: first when players compete in an infinitely repeated market like above, second when the market as an exogenous probability of ending after each period, and third when firms compete in both markets simultaneously.</p>

<h3 id="case-1">Case 1:</h3>

<p>Suppose players are competing in a market with inverse demand \(D(p)\), call it market A, and have a discount factor \(\delta \lt 1\). The history at any period \(T\) is given by:</p>

<p>$$ H_{T-1} = \{ (p_{i,t}); i=1,2,...,N; t=1,2,...,T-1 \} $$</p>

<p>The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trigger_strategy">trigger strategy</a> I define for each player \(i\) to collude is:</p>

<p>$$ p_{i,t} =
\begin{cases}
p_m \ \ \text{if all elements of} \ \ H_{t-1} = p_m, \ \ \text{or if} \ \ t=1 \cr
c \ \ \text{otherwise}
\end{cases} $$</p>

<p>where \(p_m\) is the monopoly price, and \(\pi_m\) is the monopoly profit. We assume that if the firms collude, they do so optimally - they set the price at the monopoly price and divide the profits equally. This is better than pricing at marginal cost and earning 0 profits. But in every period, there is an incentive for firms to deviate and slightly undercut everyone else, capturing the full monopoly profits for one period if they do. However, when they do this everyone goes into the punishment phase and plays \(p=c\), so nobody makes any profits after that. The decision to cooperate or deviate comes down to weighing a stream of small payoffs every period against one big payoff today, for which the discount factor \(\delta\) is critical.</p>

<p>The firms&#39; payoffs from cooperating and deviating optimally are:</p>

<p>$$\begin{align}
\text{Cooperate:} &amp; \ \ \frac{\pi_m}{N} + \delta\frac{\pi_m}{N} + \delta^2\frac{\pi_m}{N} + ... \cr
&amp; = \frac{\pi_m}{N}\frac{1}{1-\delta} \cr \cr
\text{Deviate:} &amp; \ \ \pi_m + 0 + 0 + ... \cr
&amp; = \pi_m \cr
\end{align}$$</p>

<p>To find the minimum \(\delta\) that can support collusion, we set the cooperation payoff to be greater than or equal to the deviation payoff and solve for \(\delta\). This gives us that the critical discount factor is</p>

<p>$$\delta_c \ge \frac{N-1}{N} $$</p>

<p>So as \(N \to \infty\), \(\delta_c \to 1\). Collusion becomes harder to sustain when there are more firms, as it requires each firm to weight future payoffs increasingly heavily against current payoffs.</p>

<h3 id="case-2">Case 2:</h3>

<p>In this case, there is an exogenous probability \(\alpha\) that the market will end after each period. Let&#39;s call this market B. The strategy we defined earlier can be applied here and the deviation payoff is the same, but the cooperation payoff is a little different:</p>

<p>$$\begin{align}
\text{Cooperate:} &amp; \ \ \frac{\pi_m}{N} + \delta(1-\alpha)\frac{\pi_m}{N} + \delta^2(1-\alpha)^2\frac{\pi_m}{N} + ... \cr
&amp; = \frac{\pi_m}{N}\frac{1}{1-\delta(1-\alpha)} \cr
\end{align} $$</p>

<p>Solving for the critical discount factor, we get</p>

<p>$$\delta_c(1-\alpha) \ge \frac{N-1}{N} $$</p>

<p>The higher the probability that the market will end after today, the less likely collusion is since the expected payoff from colluding is smaller. Since the market could end at any period, colluding has an opportunity cost if the market does end.</p>

<h3 id="case-3">Case 3:</h3>

<p>Finally, what if the firms compete in markets A and B simultaneously? Is collusion more or less likely then? The strategies and payoffs are a bit different here.</p>

<p>The history at time T is: </p>

<p>$$ H_{T-1} = \{ (p_{i,t,A},p_{i,t,B}); i=1,2,...,N; t=1,2,...,T-1\} $$</p>

<p>The trigger strategy I define is:</p>

<p>$$ (p_{i,t,A},p_{i,t,B}) =
\begin{cases}
(p_m,p_m) \ \ \text{if all elements of} \ \ H_{t-1} = (p_m,p_m), \text{or if} \ \ t=1 \cr
c \ \ \text{otherwise}
\end{cases} $$</p>

<p>The payoffs from cooperating and deviating are:</p>

<p>$$\begin{align}
\text{Cooperate:} &amp; \ \ (\frac{\pi_m}{N} + \frac{\pi_m}{N}) + (\delta\frac{\pi_m}{N} + \delta(1-\alpha)\frac{\pi_m}{N}) + (\delta^2\frac{\pi_m}{N} + \delta^2(1-\alpha)^2\frac{\pi_m}{N}) + ... \cr
&amp; = 2\frac{\pi_m}{N} + \frac{\pi_m}{N}\frac{\delta(1+(1-\alpha))}{1-\delta(1+(1-\alpha))} \cr \cr
\text{Deviate:} &amp; \ \ 2\pi_m + 0 + 0 + ... \cr
&amp; = 2\pi_m \cr
\end{align}$$</p>

<p>I&#39;m defining this as simply as I can: firms collude if other firms cooperate in both markets. Any firm who deviates is going to deviate in both markets at the same time. If firms see another firm deviate in either market, all firms go into the punishment phase and play \(p=c\) forever after. This way of defining it makes sense to me because deviating in both markets is better than deviating in one market, given the trigger strategy. The trigger strategy prevents the possibility of a firm repeatedly defecting in only one market at a time. So it&#39;s all internally consistent, which is good.</p>

<p>Solving like before, we get</p>

<p>$$\delta_c(2-\alpha) \ge \frac{2(N-1)}{1+2(N-1)} $$</p>

<p>When \(N=2\), we get that \(\delta_c(2-\alpha) \ge \frac{2}{3}\). As \(N \to \infty\), \(\frac{2(N-1)}{1+2(N-1)} \to 1\). Looking at this expression, it seems like collusion is more likely in case 3 than in case 2. My intuition for this is that when firms compete in both markets, their payoff from deviating is doubled. However, their payoff from cooperating is more than doubled, since they earn more from cooperating in market A than in market B and now they get both payoffs if they cooperate. So, the payoff from colluding in market A acts as a &quot;stabilizer&quot;, reducing the effects of the uncertainty of when market B will end.</p>

<h3 id="summary">Summary</h3>

<p>The one-shot and finitely-repeated Bertrand games have very vicious competition, but as we see here the infinitely-repeated Bertrand game can support collusion if firms value the future highly enough. As the number of firms increases, collusion gets harder to support. When the market might end at any time, collusion gets harder to support. One way to make collusion more feasible when a market could end at any time is to have the firms compete simultaneously in another market that won&#39;t end. Repeated-play makes things interesting.</p>

      <a href="/micro%20theory/2015/10/02/passthrough-symmetric-cournot/">
        Deriving pass-through for an N-firm Cournot oligopoly
      </a>
    </h1>

    <span class="post-date">02 Oct 2015</span>

    <p>In the <a href="http://akhilrao.github.io/micro%20theory/2015/10/01/asymmetric-hotelling/">previous post</a>, I mentioned the concept of pass-through. Pass-through is the partial derivative of price with respect to marginal cost; it tells us how the equilibrium price will change in response to a change in marginal cost. As we will see here, it is closely related to the curvature of the inverse demand function.</p>

<p>Consider a homogeneous product market with \(N \ge 2\) firms which are Cournot competitors with the same constant marginal cost \( c\). The inverse demand function is \(P(Q)\), and it satisfies \(2P&#39;(Q) + QP&#39;&#39;(Q) \lt 0\). The first order condition for firm \(i\) when every firm produces positive output is given by \( P(Q) + q_{i}P&#39;(Q) - c = 0 \). Because the firms are symmetric, \(q_i = \frac{Q}{N}\), making firm \(i\)&#39;s first order condition \(P(Q) + \frac{Q}{N}P&#39;(Q) - c = 0\). Call this FOC as \(F\).</p>

<p>Define \( \sigma(Q) = -\frac{QP&#39;&#39;(Q)}{P&#39;(Q)} \), the curvature of the inverse demand function.</p>

<p>By the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Implicit_function_theorem">implicit function theorem</a>, we can find \(\frac{\partial Q}{\partial c}\), the quantity pass-through, as</p>

<p>$$ \begin{align}
 \frac{\partial Q}{\partial c} &amp; = - \frac{\frac{\partial F}{\partial c}}{\frac{\partial F}{\partial c}} \cr
 &amp; = \frac{N}{(N+1)P&#39;(Q) + QP&#39;&#39;(Q)} \cr
\end{align} $$</p>

<p>Then, by the chain rule,</p>

<p>$$ \begin{align}
\frac{\partial P(Q)}{\partial c} &amp; = \frac{\partial P}{\partial Q}\frac{\partial Q}{\partial c} \cr
\implies \frac{\partial P(Q)}{\partial c} &amp; = \frac{\partial P}{\partial Q} \frac{N}{(N+1)P&#39;(Q) + QP&#39;&#39;(Q)} \cr
\end{align} $$</p>

<p>Dividing by \(\frac{\partial P}{\partial Q}\) on top and bottom, we get</p>

<p>$$ \begin{align} 
\frac{\partial P}{\partial c} &amp; =  \frac{N}{(N+1) + Q\frac{P&#39;&#39;(Q)}{P&#39;(Q)}} \cr
&amp; = \frac{N}{(N+1) = \sigma(Q)} \cr
\end{align} $$</p>

<p>Thus, we see that the pass-through rate is indeed a function of the curvature of the inverse demand function. If we assume inverse demand is linear, we get</p>

<p>$$P&#39;(c) = \frac{N}{N+1}$$</p>

<p>As \( N \to \infty\), \(P&#39;(c) \to 1\). This makes sense, given that we know as \( N \to \infty\), \(P \to c\).</p>

<p>Pass-through is a pretty useful concept, and it seems to be a popular tool these days in analyses of oligopoly and market power.</p>

        Hotelling duopoly with different valuations and a merger
      </a>
    </h1>

    <span class="post-date">01 Oct 2015</span>

    <p>Consider a Hotelling duopoly on opposite ends of a linear city of length 1. <a href="http://akhilrao.github.io/micro%20theory/2015/09/28/hotelling-triangle-city/">We know</a> that if the firms and products are symmetric, the indifferent consumer is at the midpoint and the price is greater than marginal cost by the travel cost (\(\tilde{x}=\frac{1}{2}, p=t+c\)). Suppose the firms are symmetric with constant marginal cost \(c\), but consumers value their products at \(v_1\) and \(v_2\), respectively. Assume that \(v_1\) and \(v_2\) are high enough that the market will be covered, and that the firms choose prices simultaneously. As before, we first find the indifferent consumer&#39;s demand and then plug it into the firms&#39; profit-maximization problems.</p>

<p>The indifferent consumer&#39;s demand:</p>

<p>$$ \begin{align}
&amp; v_1 - p_1 - t\tilde{x} = v_2 - p_2 - t(1-\tilde{x}) \cr
\cr
\implies &amp; \tilde{x} = \frac{(v_1-v_2)-(p_1-p_2)}{2t} + \frac{1}{2} \cr
\end{align} $$</p>

<p>The firms&#39; first-order conditions and optimal prices:</p>

<p>$$ \begin{align}
\text{Firm 1:} &amp; \ \ \frac{1}{2}[1 + \frac{(v_1-v_2)-(2p_1-p_2)-c}{t}] = 0 \cr
\text{Firm 2:} &amp; \ \ \frac{1}{2}[1 + \frac{(v_1-v_2)-(p_1-2p_2)-c}{t}] = 0 \cr \cr
p_1 &amp; = \frac{1}{2}[v_1-v_2+p_2^* + \frac{t}{2} + c] \cr
p_2 &amp; = \frac{1}{2}[v_2-v_1+p_1^* + \frac{t}{2} + c] \cr
\end{align} $$</p>

<p>As we&#39;d expect, each firm&#39;s optimal price is increasing in consumers&#39; valuations of their own product, decreasing in consumers&#39; valuations of their competitor&#39;s product, and increasing in their marginal cost. Interestingly, their own optimal prices are increasing in their competitor&#39;s price. I think the correct terms are &quot;strategic substitutes&quot; and &quot;strategic complements&quot;, but I could be mistaken.</p>

<p>In Cournot models, if the other firm increases their quantity, you want to decrease yours - we see this from the Cournot best-response, \( q_i^* = \frac{-(p(Q) - c)}{\frac{\partial p}{\partial Q}} \) (which is \(q_i^* = \frac{a - bq_j^* - c}{2b} \) when inverse demand is linear), where \(\frac{\partial q_i}{\partial q_j} \lt 0\). The quantities are &quot;strategic substitutes&quot;. This linkage is through the inverse demand function, where one firm increasing its quantity results in a lower price for all firms.</p>

<p>In Hotelling models the opposite is true regarding prices - they are &quot;strategic complements&quot;, or \(\frac{\partial p_i}{\partial p_j} \gt 0\). My intuition for this is that the other firm raising its price gives you room to raise yours; as long as we assume the market is covered, there is a single indifferent consumer choosing between the two firms who links their prices in this way. If the market isn&#39;t covered, I think you would have two indifferent consumers, one for each firm, each consumer indifferent between buying from the nearer firm or not buying at all. Then the firms&#39; problems would be decoupled, and \(\frac{\partial p_i}{\partial p_j}\) would be 0.</p>

<p>How much would a change in cost affect the price? We can see this by looking at \(\frac{\partial p_i}{\partial c}\) for any \(i\). This is called the &quot;pass-through rate&quot;, or just the &quot;pass-through&quot;. In a <a href="http://akhilrao.github.io/micro%20theory/2015/10/02/passthrough-symmetric-cournot/">future post</a>, I&#39;ll derive the pass-through rate for a Cournot oligopolist and relate it to the curvature of the inverse demand function. Here, the pass-through is easy: \(\frac{\partial p_i}{\partial c} = \frac{1}{2}\).</p>

<p>What if the firms merged and became a monopolist selling two differentiated products? In this case, the firm can capture all of the consumer surplus. The indifferent consumer&#39;s demand becomes:</p>

<p>$$ \begin{align}
&amp; v_1 - p_1 - t\tilde{x} = v_2 - p_2 - t(1-\tilde{x}) = 0 \cr \cr
\implies &amp; \tilde{x} = \frac{(v_1-p_1)}{t}, \cr
 &amp; \tilde{x} = \frac{v_2-p_2}{t} + 1 \cr
\end{align} $$</p>

<p>We can use the two expressions we have for \(\tilde{x}\) to get a function that relates \(p_1\) to \(p_2\). I&#39;m going to go with \(p_2 = p_1 - v_1 + v_2 + t \). Now we solve the firm&#39;s problem and get the prices:</p>

<p>$$ \begin{align}
&amp; \max_{p_1} \ [p_1 + p_2(p_1) - c]\tilde{x}(p_1) \cr
\implies &amp; p_1 = \frac{1}{4}[3v_1 - v_2 + t + c] \cr
\implies &amp; p_2 = \frac{1}{4}[5v_2 - v_1 + 5t + c] \cr
\end{align} $$</p>

<p>\(p_1\) and \(p_2\) look a little weird to me, with the fractions and numbers, but I double-checked my algebra and I think it&#39;s right. Anyway, the signs on the derivatives make sense. As the indifferent consumer&#39;s valuation of product 1 increases (decreases), the price of product 2 decreases (increases), and vice versa. The price is increasing in travel and marginal costs.</p>

<p>I like the addition of the firms merging. I&#39;d like to look at some more models with that.</p>

<p>Variations to explore:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>A merger between two firms in Triangle City</p></li>
<li><p>A model of Circle City with \(n\) firms</p></li>
<li><p>A merger between two firms in an \(n\)-firm Circle City</p></li>
<li><p>A Hotelling model on a not-fully-connected graph? Consumers and firms would be at the nodes, with the cost of reaching a firm increasing in the number of nodes between a consumer and the firm. I think it would be a lot harder to solve than a Hotelling model on a continuous space, but the linkages in price through demand would be interesting. Maybe a continuous city on a polygon with lines between vertices is an easier way to look at those linkages.</p></li>

        Asymmetric Cournot with discrete quantities
      </a>
    </h1>

    <span class="post-date">30 Sep 2015</span>

    <p>In standard Cournot models, firms are symmetric and choose continuous quantities (\(q_i \in \mathbb{R_+}\)). Here we consider a model of Cournot duopoly with asymmetric firms limited to discrete quantities (\(q_i \in \mathbb{Z_+}\)). Because the set we are optimizing over is no longer continuous, we can&#39;t use the Kuhn-Tucker approach used in Cournot models with continuous quantities. Instead, we set up the problem as a game in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Normal-form_game">normal form</a> and find the pure- and mixed-strategy Nash equilibria by using <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strategic_dominance">iterated elimination of dominated strategies</a>.</p>

<p>Let firm 1 have marginal cost \(c_1 = 4\) and firm 2 have marginal cost \(c_2 = 5\). Let the inverse demand function be given by 
$$ \begin{align}
P(Q)=\begin{cases} 10 - Q \ \ &amp; if \ \ Q \le 10 \cr 
0 \ \ &amp; if \ \ Q \gt 10 \end{cases} 
\end{align} $$</p>

<p>and \( Q = q_1 + q_2\).</p>

<p>To start, we can eliminate any quantities greater than the firm&#39;s monopoly quantities. That&#39;s what the firm would do if it wasn&#39;t constrained by its competitor, so it can&#39;t be profit-maximizing to play anything above those quantities. To find the monopoly quantities, we can take the standard Cournot duopoly best-response function, \(q_i^* = \frac{a - bq_j^* - c_i}{2b}\), and plug in \( q_j^* = 0\). This gives us that firm 1&#39;s monopoly quantity is 3, and firm 2&#39;s is 2.5. We can eliminate any quantity choice greater than 3 for both firms, since they are strictly dominated.</p>

<p>How do we handle 2.5? Firm 2 has to choose 2 or 3, not 2.5. We can see that \(\pi_2(q_1=0,q_2=3) = 6\) and \(\pi_2(q_1=0,q_2=2) = 6 \), so we can&#39;t eliminate 3 from firm 2&#39;s choices by strict domination.</p>

        When tutors signal quality to students by higher prices

    <p>Why do economics tutors who charge higher prices seem to get more students? Signalling may explain this if price is interpreted as a signal of quality. Such signalling may be an equilibrium outcome if students do not share information about tutor quality.</p>
