        A symmetric Circle City Hotelling model
      </a>
    </h1>

    <span class="post-date">05 Oct 2015</span>

    <p>This model is very similar to <a href="">Triangle City</a>.</p>

<h3 id="circle-city">Circle City</h3>

<p>Let the circle be of circumference \(r\pi\). There are \(n\) symmetric firms facing marginal cost \(c\) located equidistant from each other on the circle. Firm \(i\) faces two marginal consumers: \(x_{i-1}\) (the firm to its left) and \(x_i\) (the firm to its right). The marginal consumers are identical, and firm \(i\) and firm \(i+1\) compete over consumer \(x_i\). Consumers face a travel cost of t. \(x_i\)&#39;s utility is given by:</p>

<p>$$\begin{align} 
v - p_i - tx_i &amp;= v - p_{i+1} - t(\frac{tr\pi}{n}-x_i) \cr
\implies x_i &amp;= \frac{p_{i+1}-p_i+(tr\pi/n)}{2t} \cr
\end{align}$$</p>

<p>Since the consumers are identical, this holds for every marginal consumer. Firm \(i\) faces \(x_i + x_{i-1}\), and solves</p>

<p>$$max_p (p_i-c)\left[\frac{p_{i+1}-p_i+(tr\pi/n)}{2t} + \frac{p_{i-1}-p_i+(tr\pi/n)}{2t} \right] $$</p>

<p>$$\begin{align} 
\text{FOC:} &amp;~~~ \left[\frac{p_{i+1}-p_i+(tr\pi/n)}{2t} + \frac{p_{i-1}-p_i+(tr\pi/n)}{2t} \right] - (p_i-c)\frac{2}{2t} \cr
\implies &amp; ~~~ \frac{tr\pi}{n} - (p_i-c)\frac{1}{t} = 0 ~~~~~~ (\pi_i=\pi_j ~ \forall~i,j~\because \text{firms are symmetric})\cr
\implies &amp; p_i^* = c + \frac{tr\pi}{n}
\end{align}$$</p>

<p>So the markup is increasing in the radius of the circle (\(\frac{\partial p}{\partial r} \gt 0\)) and the travel cost (\(\frac{\partial p}{\partial } \gt 0\)), and decreasing in the number of firms (\(n \to \infty\), \(p \to c\)).</p>

<p>The fact that firm \(i\) faces 2 (or \(k\), I suppose) symmetric marginal customers doesn&#39;t affect the equilibrium prices \(p_i^*\), only equilibrium profits \(\pi_i^*\) (scaled by \(k\)).</p>

        Asymmetric Cournot with discrete quantities
      </a>
    </h1>

    <span class="post-date">05 Oct 2015</span>

    <p>In standard Cournot models, firms are symmetric and choose continuous quantities (\(q_i \in \mathbb{R_+}\)). Here we consider a model of Cournot duopoly with asymmetric firms limited to discrete quantities (\(q_i \in \mathbb{Z_+}\)). Because the set we are optimizing over is no longer continuous, we can&#39;t use the Kuhn-Tucker approach used in Cournot models with continuous quantities. Instead, we set up the problem as a game in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Normal-form_game">normal form</a> and find the pure- and mixed-strategy Nash equilibria by using <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strategic_dominance">iterated elimination of dominated strategies</a>.</p>

<h3 id="the-setting">The setting</h3>

<p>Let firm 1 have marginal cost \(c_1 = 4\) and firm 2 have marginal cost \(c_2 = 5\). Let the inverse demand function be given by 
$$ \begin{align}
P(Q)=\begin{cases} 10 - Q \ \ &amp; if \ \ Q \le 10 \cr 
0 \ \ &amp; if \ \ Q \gt 10 \end{cases} 
\end{align} $$</p>

<p>and \( Q = q_1 + q_2\).</p>

<p>To start, we can eliminate any quantities greater than the firm&#39;s monopoly quantities. That&#39;s what the firm would do if it wasn&#39;t constrained by its competitor, so it can&#39;t be profit-maximizing to play anything above those quantities. To find the monopoly quantities, we can take the standard Cournot duopoly best-response function, \(q_i^* = \frac{a - bq_j^* - c_i}{2b}\), and plug in \( q_j^* = 0\). This gives us that firm 1&#39;s monopoly quantity is 3, and firm 2&#39;s is 2.5. We can eliminate any quantity choice greater than 3 for both firms, since they are strictly dominated.</p>

<p>How do we handle 2.5? Firm 2 has to choose 2 or 3, not 2.5. We can see that \(\pi_2(q_1=0,q_2=3) = 6\) and \(\pi_2(q_1=0,q_2=2) = 6 \), so we can&#39;t eliminate 3 from firm 2&#39;s choices by strict domination.</p>

<p>The game matrix below shows the firms&#39; profits. Firm 1 is on the columns, and firm 2 is on the rows. The entries are &quot;payoff(firm 1), payoff(firm 2)&quot;.</p>

<p>$$\begin{array}{c|lcr}
 &amp; 0 &amp; 1 &amp; 2 &amp; 3 \cr
\hline
0 &amp; 0,0 &amp; 5,0 &amp; 8,0 &amp; 9,0 \cr
1 &amp; 0,4 &amp; 4,3 &amp; 6,2 &amp; 6,1 \cr
2 &amp; 0,6 &amp; 3,4 &amp; 4,2 &amp; 3,0 \cr
3 &amp; 0,6 &amp; 2,3 &amp; 2,0 &amp; 0,-3
\end{array}$$</p>

<p>Iterated elimination:</p>

<ul>
<li>Firm 1: 1 strictly dominates 0 \(\implies\) remove 0-column</li>
<li>Firm 2: 2 strictly dominates 3 \(\implies\) remove 3-row</li>
<li>Firm 1: 2 strictly dominates 1 \(\implies\) remove 1-column</li>
<li>Firm 2: 1 strictly dominates 0 \(\implies\) remove 0-row</li>
</ul>

<p>This leaves us with the following 2x2 game matrix:</p>

<p>$$\begin{array}{c|lr}
 &amp; 2 &amp; 3 \cr
\hline
1 &amp; 6,2 &amp; 6,1 \cr
2 &amp; 4,2 &amp; 3,0 \cr
\end{array}$$</p>

<p>There are 3 pure-strategy Nash equilibria, \((q_1,q_2,\pi_1,\pi_2)\):</p>

<ol>
<li>\((2,1,6,2)\)</li>
<li>\((2,2,4,2)\)</li>
<li>\((3,1,6,1)\)</li>
</ol>

<p>Letting \(p_1 = Pr(q_2=1), p_2 = Pr(q_2=2), k_2=Pr(q_1=2), k_3=Pr(q_1=3)\), we can get their expected utilities:</p>

<p>$$\begin{align}
EU_{1}(2) &amp; = p_1(6) + p_2(4) = 6p_1 + 4p_2 \cr
EU_{1}(3) &amp; = p_1(6) + p_2(3) = 6p_1 + 3p_2 \cr
EU_{2}(1) &amp; = k_2(2) + k_3(1) = 2k_2 + k_3 \cr
EU_{2}(2) &amp; = k_2(2) + k_3(0) = 2k_2 \cr
\end{align}$$</p>

<p>By applying expected-utility indifference, we can construct a mixed NE.</p>

<p>$$\begin{align}
EU_1(2) &amp; = EU_1(3) \cr
EU_2(1) &amp; = EU_2(2) \cr
\implies p_2&amp;=0,p_1=1 \cr
 k_3&amp;=0,k_2=1 \cr 
\end{align}$$</p>

<p>This is odd: The mixed NE that&#39;s coming out is a degenerate one, pure NE #1. I think I remember something about there needs to be an odd number of pure + mixed NE to a matrix game in total, so this might imply that there are actually no mixed NE? I was told that this game actually has infinitely many mixed NE, but I don&#39;t see it.</p>

      <a href="/micro%20theory/2015/10/04/monopoly-pricing-discrete-demand/">
        Monopoly pricing for discrete demand
      </a>
    </h1>

    <span class="post-date">04 Oct 2015</span>

    <p>How should a monopoly price when demand is discrete? This situation arises whenever the consumer is choosing between &quot;buy&quot; or &quot;not buy&quot;, as opposed to a choice of a continuous quantity.</p>

<p>Let the consumers&#39; valuations of the good be given by \(V \sim F(v)\), where \(F(v)\) is the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cumulative_distribution_function">CDF</a> of the valuations and \(f(p)\) is the associated density. The probability that a consumer chooses to buy the good is the probability that their valuation is greater than the price, i.e. \(1-F(p)\). The seller&#39;s expected payoff is then</p>

<p>$$ \pi(p) = (p-c)(1-F(p)) $$</p>

<p>This is the usual profit expression, but with \(1-F(p)\) as the demand. Maximizing this gives us</p>

<p>$$ \begin{align}
 \text{FOC:} \ \ &amp; 1 - F(p) - pf(p) + cf(p) = 0 \cr
 \implies \ \ &amp; p = c + \frac{1-F(p)}{f(p)} \cr
\end{align}$$</p>

<p>This is called &quot;markup pricing&quot;; the price is the marginal cost \(c\) plus a markup, \( \frac{1-F(p)}{f(p)} \). The markup is the inverse of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Failure_rate#hazard_function">hazard rate</a> of the demand function. The hazard rate measures how likely an event (a &quot;failure&quot;, or &quot;hazard&quot;) is to happen given that it hasn&#39;t happened before. In the case of demand, the hazard rate is the probability that a consumer will buy the good at a certain price \(p\), conditional on having not bought the good before. So it makes some sense that the markup would be based on the hazard rate of demand.</p>

<h3 id="an-example">An example</h3>

<p>Suppose \( F(v) \sim U[a,b]\) - the consumers are equally likely to be willing to pay anywhere from \(a\) to \(b\) for the product. Then \(F(v) = \frac{v-a}{b-a} \), and \(f(v) = \frac{1}{b-a}\). Plugging this into the pricing formula we derived above, we get</p>

<p>$$\begin{align}
p &amp; = c + \frac{1- \frac{p-a}{b-a}}{\frac{1}{b-a}} \cr
\implies p &amp; = \frac{c+b}{2} \cr
\end{align}$$</p>

<p>So, for uniformly distributed valuations of the product, the monopolist should optimally price their product at half of marginal cost plus the maximum valuation.</p>

<h3 id="more-on-the-hazard-rate">More on the hazard rate</h3>

<p>The hazard rate, \(\lambda\), turns out to be important to analyzing markets. We usually assume that \(\lambda\) is nondecreasing in \(p\). This is equivalent to assuming that the density of demand is log-concave. A proof of the statement follows.</p>

<h5 id="proof">Proof</h5>

<p>$$\begin{align}
f&#39;(x)[1-F(x)] &amp; = \int_x^\infty f&#39;(x)f(t)dt \cr
 &amp; = \int_x^\infty \frac{f&#39;(x)}{f(x)}f(t)f(x)dt \cr
 &amp; \ge \int_x^\infty \frac{f&#39;(t)}{f(t)}f(t)f(x)dt  ~~~~(\because t \ge x) \cr
 &amp; = f(x)[f(\infty) - f(x)]
 &amp; \ge - f(x)^2
\end{align}$$</p>

<p>So log-concave \(f(x) \equiv \lambda\) is nondecreasing. </p>

        Repeated play and collusion in an N-firm Bertrand oligopoly
      </a>
    </h1>

    <span class="post-date">03 Oct 2015</span>

    <p>So far, <a href="http://akhilrao.github.io/micro%20theory/2015/09/29/bertrand-cournot-oligopoly/">we&#39;ve seen</a> one-shot Bertrand games with up to \(N\) firms. What happens if the firms are playing a Bertrand game repeatedly for \(T\) periods?</p>

<p>Consider a repeated Bertrand oligopoly with \(N \ge 2\) firms, played for \(T \lt \infty\) periods. We know that the one-shot Nash equilibrium is \(p_{i}=c \ \ \ \forall i \). For \(T\) periods, we start at the last period and work backwards (backwards induction).</p>

<p>In the last period, the game is a one-shot Bertrand game. Thus the equilibrium price will be \(p_{i,T}=c \ \ \ \forall i\). Each firm knows that in period \(T-1\), and  since there&#39;s no possibility of colluding tomorrow they each play \(p_{i,T-1}=c\). We can extend the argument to see that \(p_{i,t}=c \ \ \ \forall t,i\).</p>

<p>What if \(T = \infty\)? If the game is infinitely repeated, we can&#39;t apply backwards induction since there is no last period. Instead, we define trigger strategies and look for parameter restrictions that would need to hold to make the strategy a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subgame_perfect_equilibrium">subgame-perfect Nash equilibrium</a>. </p>

<p>Let&#39;s take the same example, and assume that play is history-dependent, i.e. players consider what happened before in deciding what to do today. We&#39;ll consider 3 cases: first when players compete in an infinitely repeated market like above, second when the market as an exogenous probability of ending after each period, and third when firms compete in both markets simultaneously.</p>

<h3 id="case-1">Case 1:</h3>

<p>Suppose players are competing in a market with inverse demand \(D(p)\), call it market A, and have a discount factor \(\delta \lt 1\). The history at any period \(T\) is given by:</p>

<p>$$ H_{T-1} = \{ (p_{i,t}); i=1,2,...,N; t=1,2,...,T-1 \} $$</p>

<p>The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trigger_strategy">trigger strategy</a> I define for each player \(i\) to collude is:</p>

<p>$$ p_{i,t} =
\begin{cases}
p_m \ \ \text{if all elements of} \ \ H_{t-1} = p_m, \ \ \text{or if} \ \ t=1 \cr
c \ \ \text{otherwise}
\end{cases} $$</p>

<p>where \(p_m\) is the monopoly price, and \(\pi_m\) is the monopoly profit. We assume that if the firms collude, they do so optimally - they set the price at the monopoly price and divide the profits equally. This is better than pricing at marginal cost and earning 0 profits. But in every period, there is an incentive for firms to deviate and slightly undercut everyone else, capturing the full monopoly profits for one period if they do. However, when they do this everyone goes into the punishment phase and plays \(p=c\), so nobody makes any profits after that. The decision to cooperate or deviate comes down to weighing a stream of discounted payoffs every period against one big payoff today. The discount factor, \(\delta \in (0,1)\) determines how heavily firms weigh future payoffs against present payoffs.</p>

<p>The firms&#39; payoffs from cooperating and deviating optimally are:</p>

<p>$$\begin{align}
\text{Cooperate:} &amp; \ \ \frac{\pi_m}{N} + \delta\frac{\pi_m}{N} + \delta^2\frac{\pi_m}{N} + ... \cr
&amp; = \frac{\pi_m}{N}\frac{1}{1-\delta} \cr \cr
\text{Deviate:} &amp; \ \ \pi_m + 0 + 0 + ... \cr
&amp; = \pi_m \cr
\end{align}$$</p>

<p>To find the minimum \(\delta\) that can support collusion, we set the cooperation payoff to be greater than or equal to the deviation payoff and solve for \(\delta\). This gives us that the critical discount factor is</p>

<p>$$\delta_c \ge \frac{N-1}{N} $$</p>

<p>So as \(N \to \infty\), \(\delta_c \to 1\). When \(N=2, \delta_c \ge \frac{1}{2}\). Collusion becomes harder to sustain when there are more firms, as it requires each firm to weight future payoffs increasingly heavily against current payoffs.</p>

<h3 id="case-2">Case 2:</h3>

<p>In this case, there is an exogenous probability \(\alpha \in (0,1)\) that the market will end after each period. Let&#39;s call this market B. The strategy we defined earlier can be applied here and the deviation payoff is the same, but the cooperation payoff is a little different:</p>

<p>$$\begin{align}
\text{Cooperate:} &amp; \ \ \frac{\pi_m}{N} + \delta(1-\alpha)\frac{\pi_m}{N} + \delta^2(1-\alpha)^2\frac{\pi_m}{N} + ... \cr
&amp; = \frac{\pi_m}{N}\frac{1}{1-\delta(1-\alpha)} \cr
\end{align} $$</p>

<p>Solving for the critical discount factor, we get</p>

<p>$$\delta_c \ge \frac{N-1}{N}\frac{1}{(1-\alpha)} $$</p>

<p>When \(N=2\): </p>

<ul>
<li>\(\alpha\to0 \implies \delta_c \ge \frac{1}{2}\)</li>
<li>\(\alpha=\frac{1}{2} \implies \delta_c \ge 1\)</li>
<li>\(\alpha\to1 \implies \delta_c \ge \infty\)</li>
</ul>

<p>If the market will survive with probability 1, they are as likely to cooperate as in case 1. If the market is 50% or more likely to end tomorrow, they will not cooperate.</p>

<h3 id="case-3">Case 3:</h3>

<p>Finally, what if the firms compete in markets A and B simultaneously? Is collusion more or less likely then? The strategies and payoffs are a bit different here.</p>

<p>The history at time T is: </p>

<p>$$ H_{T-1} = \{ (p_{i,t,A},p_{i,t,B}); i=1,2,...,N; t=1,2,...,T-1\} $$</p>

<p>The trigger strategy I define is:</p>

<p>$$ (p_{i,t,A},p_{i,t,B}) =
\begin{cases}
(p_m,p_m) \ \ \text{if all elements of} \ \ H_{t-1} = (p_m,p_m), \text{or if} \ \ t=1 \cr
c \ \ \text{otherwise}
\end{cases} $$</p>

<p>The payoffs from cooperating and deviating are:</p>

<p>$$\begin{align}
\text{Cooperate:} &amp; \ \ (\frac{\pi_m}{N} + \frac{\pi_m}{N}) + (\delta\frac{\pi_m}{N} + \delta(1-\alpha)\frac{\pi_m}{N}) + (\delta^2\frac{\pi_m}{N} + \delta^2(1-\alpha)^2\frac{\pi_m}{N}) + ... \cr
&amp; = 2\frac{\pi_m}{N} + \frac{\pi_m}{N}\frac{\delta(1+(1-\alpha))}{1-\delta(1+(1-\alpha))} \cr \cr
\text{Deviate:} &amp; \ \ 2\pi_m + 0 + 0 + ... \cr
&amp; = 2\pi_m \cr
\end{align}$$</p>

<p>I&#39;m defining this as simply as I can: firms collude if other firms cooperate in both markets. Any firm who deviates is going to deviate in both markets at the same time. If firms see another firm deviate in either market, all firms go into the punishment phase and play \(p=c\) forever after. This way of defining it makes sense to me because deviating in both markets is better than deviating in one market, given the trigger strategy. I think this trigger strategy also prevents a firm from repeatedly defecting in only one market at a time, which could happen if a double-defection was needed to initiate the punishment phase.</p>

<p>Solving like before, we get</p>

<p>$$\delta_c \ge \frac{2(N-1)}{1+2(N-1)}\frac{1}{(2-\alpha)} $$</p>

<p>As \(N \to \infty\), \(\delta_c \to 1 ~~~ \forall \alpha\). When \(N=2\): </p>

<ul>
<li>\(\alpha\to0 \implies \delta_c \ge \frac{1}{3}\)</li>
<li>\(\alpha=\frac{1}{2} \implies \delta_c \ge 1\)</li>
<li>\(\alpha\to1 \implies \delta_c \ge \frac{2}{3}\)</li>
</ul>

<p>As I understand it, \(\alpha=\frac{1}{2}\) represents a state of total uncertainty - market B is equally likely to exist or not exist tomorrow. Any non-uniform distribution over the state of market B tomorrow gives the players more information about what is likely to happen than when \(\alpha=\frac{1}{2}\). When players are completely uncertain about whether or not market B will exist tomorrow, they need to weigh tomorrow at least as heavily as today in order to cooperate (given our assumptions on \(\delta\), they can&#39;t do that). When market B survives with probability 1, they are most likely to cooperate (\(\delta \ge \frac{1}{3}\)). When market B survives with probability 0, they need a discount factor of at least \(\frac{2}{3}\) to cooperate.</p>

<p>Collusion can be more or less likely in case 3 than case 2 or case 1. Depending on how likely it is that market B will exist tomorrow the firms&#39; payoffs from cooperating can be more than doubled, but their payoffs from deviating are doubled no matter what happens to market B tomorrow.</p>

<h3 id="summary">Summary</h3>

<p>The one-shot and finitely-repeated Bertrand games have very vicious competition, but as we see here the infinitely-repeated Bertrand game can support collusion if firms value the future highly enough. As the number of firms increases, collusion gets harder to support. When the market might end at any time, collusion gets harder to support. One way to make collusion more feasible when a market could end at any time is to have the firms compete simultaneously in another market that won&#39;t end. Depending on the probability of the second market ending, the two-market case may be more collusive than a single unending market. Repeated-play makes things interesting.</p>

<li><p>Finitely-repeated and infinitely-repeated Rubinstein bargaining. Not really a variation of this - the only similarity is that they&#39;re both dynamic games - but still an interesting model.</p></li>

        Deriving pass-through for an N-firm Cournot oligopoly
      </a>
    </h1>

    <span class="post-date">02 Oct 2015</span>

    <p>In the <a href="http://akhilrao.github.io/micro%20theory/2015/10/01/asymmetric-hotelling/">previous post</a>, I mentioned the concept of pass-through. Pass-through is the partial derivative of price with respect to marginal cost; it tells us how the equilibrium price will change in response to a change in marginal cost. As we will see here, it is closely related to the curvature of the inverse demand function.</p>

<p>Consider a homogeneous product market with \(N \ge 2\) firms which are Cournot competitors with the same constant marginal cost \( c\). The inverse demand function is \(P(Q)\), and it satisfies \(2P&#39;(Q) + QP&#39;&#39;(Q) \lt 0\). The first order condition for firm \(i\) when every firm produces positive output is given by \( P(Q) + q_{i}P&#39;(Q) - c = 0 \). Because the firms are symmetric, \(q_i = \frac{Q}{N}\), making firm \(i\)&#39;s first order condition \(P(Q) + \frac{Q}{N}P&#39;(Q) - c = 0\). Call this FOC as \(F\).</p>

<p>Define \( \sigma(Q) = -\frac{QP&#39;&#39;(Q)}{P&#39;(Q)} \), the curvature of the inverse demand function.</p>

<p>By the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Implicit_function_theorem">implicit function theorem</a>, we can find \(\frac{\partial Q}{\partial c}\), the quantity pass-through, as</p>

<p>$$ \begin{align}
 \frac{\partial Q}{\partial c} &amp; = - \frac{\frac{\partial F}{\partial c}}{\frac{\partial F}{\partial c}} \cr
 &amp; = \frac{N}{(N+1)P&#39;(Q) + QP&#39;&#39;(Q)} \cr
\end{align} $$</p>

<p>Then, by the chain rule,</p>

<p>$$ \begin{align}
\frac{\partial P(Q)}{\partial c} &amp; = \frac{\partial P}{\partial Q}\frac{\partial Q}{\partial c} \cr
\implies \frac{\partial P(Q)}{\partial c} &amp; = \frac{\partial P}{\partial Q} \frac{N}{(N+1)P&#39;(Q) + QP&#39;&#39;(Q)} \cr
\end{align} $$</p>

<p>Dividing by \(\frac{\partial P}{\partial Q}\) on top and bottom, we get</p>

<p>$$ \begin{align} 
\frac{\partial P}{\partial c} &amp; =  \frac{N}{(N+1) + Q\frac{P&#39;&#39;(Q)}{P&#39;(Q)}} \cr
&amp; = \frac{N}{(N+1) - \sigma(Q)} \cr
\end{align} $$</p>

<p>Thus, we see that the pass-through rate is indeed a function of the curvature of the inverse demand function. If we assume inverse demand is linear, we get</p>

<p>$$P&#39;(c) = \frac{N}{N+1}$$</p>

<p>As \( N \to \infty\), \(P&#39;(c) \to 1\). This makes sense, given that we know as \( N \to \infty\), \(P \to c\).</p>

<p>Pass-through is a pretty useful concept, and it seems to be a popular tool these days in analyses of oligopoly and market power.</p>
