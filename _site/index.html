        When is it optimal to search for a used car?
      </a>
    </h1>

    <span class="post-date">08 Oct 2015</span>

    <p>Suppose you are considering purchasing a used car. There are \(N \ge 1\) sellers. The value of seller \(i\)&#39;s car is \(v_i\), given by</p>

<p>$$v_i =
\begin{cases}
1 ~~ \text{with probability} ~~ \beta_i \cr
0 ~~ \text{with probability} ~~ 1- \beta_i \cr
\end{cases}$$</p>

<p>where \(\beta_i = \beta^i, i=1,...,N\). So as the number of sellers increases, we only add sellers worse than the current ones. Since we search in a random order, for a given \(N\) this just tells us the distribution of sellers. A seller&#39;s \(\beta_i\) is their private information. This is sort of like Craigslist or some other internet search; you search randomly over sellers of uncertain quality. </p>

<p>You&#39;re a savvy shopper though, and before you buy the car you&#39;re going to get it inspected, which costs \(c\). You could also think about this as a search cost, to avoid confusion over inspection-less visits to sellers. Suppose the price of a car is \(1/2\) from every seller, for simplicity. You can inspect as many sellers as you want, but only one at a time.</p>

<p>Based on \(\beta\), \(N\), and \(c\), when will it be optimal for you to search at least once?</p>

<h4 id="benchmark-case-expected-utility-maximizer">Benchmark case: Expected-utility maximizer</h4>

<p>An expected utility maximizer would start by figuring out the expected quality of a seller,</p>

<p>$$\begin{align}
\hat{\beta} &amp;= \frac{1}{N} \sum_{i=1}^{N} \beta^i \cr
&amp;= \frac{\beta}{N} \left( \frac{1- \beta^N}{1- \beta } \right)
\end{align}$$</p>

<p>We assume we&#39;re starting from no prior searches so that we don&#39;t have to condition on information and update beliefs, which any optimizing agent ought to be doing. The EU-maximizer wants the expected value of a search net of inspection costs to be positive, or</p>

<p>$$\begin{align}
\hat{\beta}(v-p) - c &amp;\ge 0 \cr
 \implies \hat{\beta}(1/2) - c &amp;\ge 0 \cr
 \implies c &amp;\le \frac{1}{2}\hat{\beta} \cr
\end{align}$$</p>

<p>We use \(\hat{\beta}(v-p)\) instead of \(\hat{\beta}-p\) because our value from the car is \(1\) for sure - the uncertainty is in whether or not we see it, not in the value itself.</p>

<p>This gives us a bound on whether or not it is optimal to search - an expected-utility maximizer will search if the expected value of the car is greater than the inspection cost.</p>

<p>This makes sense, but there&#39;s another way we can approach this question.</p>

<h4 id="a-worst-case-utility-maximizer">A worst-case utility maximizer</h4>

<p>I guess another way to put this is a &quot;minimum-utility maximizer&quot;. I&#39;ve never heard that term before. I think worst-case bounds are more popular in computer science than economics, which is probably why I haven&#39;t heard it called that. </p>

<p>The worst case we could encounter on our first search is to visit seller \(N\) first. A minimum-utility maximizer only wants to search if even in this bad draw is worth their time, or</p>

<p>$$\begin{align}
\beta^N(v-p) - c &amp;\ge 0 \cr
\implies c &amp;\le \frac{1}{2}\beta^N \cr
\end{align}$$</p>

<p>which looks pretty similar to the expected-utility maximizer&#39;s solution, but with \(\beta^N\) instead of \(\hat{\beta}\). This implies a more &quot;conservative&quot; decision rule than the benchmark solution.</p>

<h4 id="summary">Summary</h4>

<p>This is a pretty cool problem. I disagreed with my professor about the solution - I used the worst-case bound, while he used the expected-utility bound. He pointed out that in this case, the worst-case bound is a subset of the expectation-bound (I think that must be true generally), so the worst-case bound ignores a large area where an expected-utility maximizer would find it optimal to search. I agree with his argument, but I still prefer the worst-case bound to the expectation-bound. In writing this post, I&#39;ve been trying to understand why.</p>

<p>I think the worst-case bound is a more general solution to the problem (or a solution to a more general problem) than the expectation-bound. In this problem, we&#39;re assuming we know a lot about the distribution of values - we know pretty much exactly what it looks like always, and so we know we can use the expectation to figure out what to do. </p>

<p>If we relax that assumption to only knowing the supports of the distribution of values, then we can&#39;t take an expectation to maximize expected utility. We can still find a worst-case bound and maximize a minimum utility in cases like this. The worst-case bound requires less information than the expected-value bound; we can set a worst-case bound even if we have no information about the distribution of sellers (or if the distribution of values is continuous and has no expectation, like a Cauchy) by looking at our own budget constraint. That said, if we have the information there&#39;s no reason to ignore it.</p>

<p>While the minimum-utility maximizer may ignore opportunities that the expected-utility maximizer would take, the minimum-utility maximizer can consistently apply their decision rule in more situations than the expected-utility maximizer can.</p>

<p>I found a neat quote on <a href="https://agtb.wordpress.com/2009/09/06/cs-and-economics-different-attitudes/">Turing&#39;s Invisible Hand</a> about this:</p>

<p><em>In a situation that already exists, there is obviously some empirical distribution, and it is hard to argue against taking it into account.  In a situation that doesnâ€™t exist, there is yet no empirical distribution, so in order to prepare for it we need to either theoretically guess the future distribution, or prepare for worst case.</em></p>

<p>Most situations we consider in economics already exist, or are similar to ones that do, so there&#39;s usually a distribution we can work with or a reasonable guess we can make. The connection between EU-maxing/minU-maxing and risk preference is interesting to me; I&#39;d like to go back to the manager&#39;s problem and add uncertainty and different risk preferences in this form between the manager and owner.</p>

<p>I like this problem. At some point, I want to try solving it with a generic distribution of values and running it in R.</p>

        A two period planner's problem with heterogeneous time preferences
      </a>
    </h1>

    <span class="post-date">07 Oct 2015</span>

    <p>Two period models are nice because they&#39;re usually easy to solve and can get at some good intuition. Two period models and most dynamic economic models use a discount rate, often \(\beta\) or \(\delta\), which is how much the agent values future payoffs in relation to present payoffs.</p>

<p>In this model there are \(n\) agents in total, \(k\) of whom have discount rate \(\beta\in [0,1]\) (impatient), and the remaining \(n-k\) with discount rate \(\beta =1\) (patient). The agents live for two periods, \(t=1,2\), and receive a consumption endowment of 1 in the period 1 and \(e\gt 0\) in period 2. They have preferences over per-period consumption given by \(\log c_t\). Their lifetime utilities are</p>

<p>$$\begin{align}
 \text{k impatient:} ~~ V(c_1,c_2) &amp;= \log c_1 + \beta \log c_2 \cr
 \text{n-k patient:} ~~ U(c_1,c_2) &amp;= \log c_1 + \log c_2 \cr
\end{align}$$</p>

<p>They want to choose consumption plans that maximize their utilities. The benevolent dictator/social planner wants to maximize the social welfare function</p>

<p>$$\begin{align}
 W &amp;= kV + (n-k)U \cr
 &amp;= k( \log c_{1}^{v} + \beta \log c_{2}^{v}) + (n-k)( \log c_{1}^{u} + \beta \log c_{2}^{u}) \cr
\end{align}$$</p>

<p>Assume the planner has to choose the same consumption plan for every agent of the same type, but can choose different consumption plans for the patient and impatient agents.</p>

<h4 id="benchmark-case-no-storage-technology">Benchmark case: No storage technology</h4>

<p>Suppose there are no refrigerators or other storage technologies, so that the consumption good can&#39;t be carried across time. The dictator&#39;s problem is</p>

<p>$$\begin{align} 
\max_p &amp; ~~W ~~ \text{s.t.}~~ c_1^u + c_1^v \le n ~ , ~ c_2^u + c_2^v \le ne \cr
\implies L &amp; = W + \lambda_1 (n-c_1^u - c_1^v) + \lambda_2 (ne-c_2^u - c_2^v) \cr
\end{align}$$</p>

<p>Since the utility functions are log, all the variables must be strictly greater than 0 and we can ignore non-negativity constraints in the lagrangian.</p>

<p>From saddle point conditions, we get that the optimal consumption plans will satisfy</p>

<p>$$\begin{align}
c_1^u + c_1^v &amp;= n \cr
c_2^u + c_2^v &amp;= ne \cr
kc_1^u &amp;= (n-k)c_1^v \cr
\beta kc_1^u &amp;= (n-k)c_1^v \cr
\end{align}$$</p>

<p>Without a use for savings, the optimal plan is to just consume all resources in the period they&#39;re received: \(c_1^v = k\), \(c_1^u = (n-k)\), and \(c_1^v=\frac{k \beta ne}{n-k(1-\beta )}, c_1^u=ne-\frac{k \beta ne}{n-k(1- \beta )}\). The lack of savings technology means \(\beta\) only affects the second period allocation, not the first. When \(\beta \lt 1\), the impatient agents receive less consumption good because they care less about this period. When \(\beta=1\) each group of agents just consumes their period endowment.</p>

<h4 id="with-a-storage-technology">With a storage technology</h4>

<p>Now suppose a storage technology is developed, so that endowments can be carried across periods. The technology has a transformation rate \(R\gt 0\) so that 1 unit of the good stored in period 1 becomes \(R\) units of the good in period 2. The dictator&#39;s problem is now</p>

<p>$$\begin{align} 
\max_p &amp; ~~W ~~ \text{s.t.}~~ R(c_1^u + c_1^v) + c_2^u + c_2^v \le ne + Rn \cr
\implies L &amp; = W + \lambda_1 (n-c_1^u - c_1^v) + \lambda_2 (ne-c_2^u - c_2^v) \cr
\end{align}$$</p>

<p>From saddle point conditions, we get that the optimal consumption plans will be</p>

<p>$$\begin{align}
c_1^u &amp;=k \cr
c_1^v &amp;=n-k \cr
c_2^u &amp;=ne-\frac{k \beta ne}{n-k(1- \beta )} \cr
c_2^v &amp;=\frac{k \beta ne}{n-k(1-\beta )} ne \cr
\end{align}$$</p>

<p>The welfare effects of the technology depends on \(\beta\) and \(R\), the rates of time preference and transformation. If the transformation rate is equal to the agent&#39;s discount rate, then the agent will be better off because they smooth their consumption by saving in the first period.</p>

<p>If \(\beta = R^{-1}\), the impatient type will be better off from the technology, but the patient type&#39;s welfare change is ambiguous. If \(\beta = R^{-1} = 1\), both types will be better off from the technology. </p>

<p>If \(\beta \neq R^{-1} \), the impatient type will not necessarily be better off. If \(\beta \neq R^{-1} \), but \(R^{-1}=1\), the patient type will be better off.</p>

<p>As long as \(\beta \lt 1\), the savings technology cannot make them both better off.</p>

        A simple labor market with two types of workers and a test
      </a>
    </h1>

    <span class="post-date">06 Oct 2015</span>

    <p>Consider a competitive labor market where workers are either high ability (&quot;high type&quot;) or low ability (&quot;low type&quot;). A worker&#39;s type is the worker&#39;s private information, but the firms are aware that a fraction \(\alpha \in (0,1)\) of the workers have high ability. The high ability worker will produce value \(v=v_h\) for the firm, and the low type will produce \(v=v_l\), where \(0\le v_l\lt v_h\lt\infty\). The worker&#39;s can produce \(r\lt v_h\) if they are self-employed (reservation wage).</p>

<h4 id="benchmark-case-no-signalling">Benchmark case: No signalling</h4>

<p>If there&#39;s no way for the worker to signal their type to the firm, then the firm will go with what it knows: that the probability of a worker having high ability is \(\alpha\). Using this, we get that the firm&#39;s expectation of the workers&#39; ability is \(E[v]=\alpha v_h + (1-\alpha) v_l\).</p>

<p>A <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Competitive_equilibrium">competitive equilibrium</a> can be described be a price \(w^*(\theta)\) and an allocation \(\theta^*(w)\) which maximize the agents&#39; expected utilities. Here, the CE is</p>

<p>$$\begin{align}
w^*(\theta)=E \ [ \ \theta \ | \ \theta \in \theta^*] \cr
\theta^*(w)= \{ \theta \ : \ r \le w \}
\end{align}$$</p>

<p>The firm will pay workers the expected value of their marginal productivity, which ends up being a constant. The workers will work if the wage is greater than or equal to what they could get staying at home. If the workers&#39; reservation wage is greater than the firm&#39;s wage (expected marginal productivity of labor), no one will work. If \(r&lt;w=E[v]\), everyone will work.</p>

<h4 id="with-a-costly-test-that-signals-types">With a costly test that signals types</h4>

<p>Now suppose there&#39;s a test that workers can take, and it&#39;s easier for high types to get a certain score than it is for low types. By observing the score that workers get on the test, firms can guess whether a worker is high ability or not. Formally,</p>

<p>$$c(e,\theta)=
\begin{cases}
c_{h}e ~~~ \text{if} ~ \theta=v_h \cr
c_{l}e ~~~ \text{if} ~ \theta=v_l
\end{cases}$$</p>

<p>where \(0\lt c_h\lt c_l\). Preparing for and taking the test is useless except that it is costlier for the low type, and can be used to distinguish between the types.</p>

<p>The equilibrium concept we use here is a Perfect Bayesian Equilibrium (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bayesian_game#Perfect_Bayesian_equilibrium">PBE</a>). The worker&#39;s choice of test score \(e(\theta)\) is optimal given their knowledge of their type, the firm&#39;s beliefs of the worker&#39;s type after observing the test score \(\mu(e)\) is formed using Bayes&#39; Rule, and the wage \(w(e)\) is a Nash equilibrium for \(e(\theta)\) given the firm&#39;s beliefs \(\mu(e)\).</p>

<p>One separating PBE that we can construct is \(w^*(e^*(v_h)) = v_h\), \(w^*(e^*(v_l)) = v_l\), \(e^*(v_l)=0\), and \(e^*(v_h)=\tilde{e}\), where \(\tilde{e}\) is the least education the high type can get while still getting utility at least as high as if they pooled with the low type.</p>

<p>The argument for this is pretty simple. If the high type can signal their ability, there&#39;s no point in the low type scoring above 0 on the test - effort is costly, and they&#39;d be better off not exerting it. If the firm can distinguish high and low types, then they will pay each their marginal product.</p>

<p>The most efficient separating PBE is when the high type engages in as little signalling behavior as possible. This occurs when the high type&#39;s education level makes them indifferent between being employed and pooling with the low type. Letting \(c_l(e)=c(e,v_l)\) and \(c_h(e)=c(e,v_h)\),</p>

<p>$$\begin{align}
e^*(v_h):&amp;~~ v_h - c_l (e^*(v_h)) = v_l \cr
\implies &amp;~ c_l (e^*(v_h)) = v_h-v_l \cr
\implies &amp;~ e^*(v_h) = c_l^{-1}(v_h-v_l) \equiv \tilde{e} \cr
\end{align}$$</p>

<p>The full PBE is</p>

<p>$$ e^*(\theta) =
\begin{cases}
0 ~~ \text{if} ~~ \theta=v_l\cr
\tilde{e} ~~ \text{if} ~~ \theta=v_h\cr
\end{cases} $$</p>

<p>$$ \mu^*(e) =
\begin{cases}
0 ~~ \text{if} ~~ e \lt \tilde{e}\cr
1 ~~ \text{if} ~~ e \ge \tilde{e}\cr
\end{cases} $$</p>

<p>$$ w^*(e) =
\begin{cases}
v_l ~~ \text{if} ~~ \theta=v_l\cr
v_h ~~ \text{if} ~~ \theta=v_h\cr
\end{cases} $$</p>

<p>This is not a unique equilibrium. There are a continuum of separating PBEs that are less efficient than this one, and a continuum of pooling PBEs with one more efficient than the rest. Whether the most efficient separating PBE is more efficient than the most efficient pooling PBE depends on the parameter values.</p>

Firm \(i\) faces two marginal consumers: \(x_{i-1}\) (the firm to its left) and \(x_i\) (the firm to its right). The marginal consumers are identical, and firm \(i\) and firm \(i+1\) compete over consumer \(x_i\). Consumers face a travel cost of t. \(x_i\)&#39;s utility is given by:</p>

<p>$$\begin{align} 
v - p_i - tx_i &amp;= v - p_{i+1} - t(\frac{td\pi}{n}-x_i) \cr
\implies x_i &amp;= \frac{p_{i+1}-p_i+(td\pi/n)}{2t} \cr
\end{align}$$</p>

<p>Since the consumers are identical, this holds for every marginal consumer. Firm \(i\) faces \(x_i + x_{i-1}\), and solves</p>

<p>$$max_p (p_i-c)\left[\frac{p_{i+1}-p_i+(td\pi/n)}{2t} + \frac{p_{i-1}-p_i+(td\pi/n)}{2t} \right] $$</p>

<p>$$\begin{align} 
\text{FOC:} &amp;~~~ \left[\frac{p_{i+1}-p_i+(td\pi/n)}{2t} + \frac{p_{i-1}-p_i+(td\pi/n)}{2t} \right] - (p_i-c)\frac{2}{2t} \cr
\implies &amp; ~~~ \frac{td\pi}{n} - (p_i-c)\frac{1}{t} = 0 ~~~~~~ (\pi_i=\pi_j ~ \forall~i,j~\because \text{firms are symmetric})\cr
\implies &amp; p_i^* = c + \frac{td\pi}{n}
\end{align}$$</p>

<p>So the markup is increasing in the diameter of the circle (\(\frac{\partial p}{\partial d} \gt 0\)) and the travel cost (\(\frac{\partial p}{\partial } \gt 0\)), and decreasing in the number of firms (\(n \to \infty\), \(p \to c\)).</p>

<p>The fact that firm \(i\) faces 2 (or \(k\), I suppose) symmetric marginal customers doesn&#39;t affect the equilibrium prices \(p_i^*\), only equilibrium profits \(\pi_i^*\) (scaled by \(k\)).</p>

        Asymmetric Cournot with discrete quantities
      </a>
    </h1>

    <span class="post-date">05 Oct 2015</span>

    <p>In standard Cournot models, firms are symmetric and choose continuous quantities (\(q_i \in \mathbb{R_+}\)). Here we consider a model of Cournot duopoly with asymmetric firms limited to discrete quantities (\(q_i \in \mathbb{Z_+}\)). Because the set we are optimizing over is no longer continuous, we can&#39;t use the Kuhn-Tucker approach used in Cournot models with continuous quantities. Instead, we set up the problem as a game in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Normal-form_game">normal form</a> and find the pure- and mixed-strategy Nash equilibria by using <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strategic_dominance">iterated elimination of dominated strategies</a>.</p>

<h3 id="the-setting">The setting</h3>

<p>Let firm 1 have marginal cost \(c_1 = 4\) and firm 2 have marginal cost \(c_2 = 5\). Let the inverse demand function be given by 
$$ \begin{align}
P(Q)=\begin{cases} 10 - Q \ \ &amp; if \ \ Q \le 10 \cr 
0 \ \ &amp; if \ \ Q \gt 10 \end{cases} 
\end{align} $$</p>

<p>and \( Q = q_1 + q_2\).</p>

<p>To start, we can eliminate any quantities greater than the firm&#39;s monopoly quantities. That&#39;s what the firm would do if it wasn&#39;t constrained by its competitor, so it can&#39;t be profit-maximizing to play anything above those quantities. To find the monopoly quantities, we can take the standard Cournot duopoly best-response function, \(q_i^* = \frac{a - bq_j^* - c_i}{2b}\), and plug in \( q_j^* = 0\). This gives us that firm 1&#39;s monopoly quantity is 3, and firm 2&#39;s is 2.5. We can eliminate any quantity choice greater than 3 for both firms, since they are strictly dominated.</p>

<p>How do we handle 2.5? Firm 2 has to choose 2 or 3, not 2.5. We can see that \(\pi_2(q_1=0,q_2=3) = 6\) and \(\pi_2(q_1=0,q_2=2) = 6 \), so we can&#39;t eliminate 3 from firm 2&#39;s choices by strict domination.</p>

<p>The game matrix below shows the firms&#39; profits. Firm 1 is on the columns, and firm 2 is on the rows. The entries are &quot;\(\pi_1, \pi_2\)&quot;.</p>

<p>$$\begin{array}{c|lcr}
 &amp; 0 &amp; 1 &amp; 2 &amp; 3 \cr
\hline
0 &amp; 0,0 &amp; 5,0 &amp; 8,0 &amp; 9,0 \cr
1 &amp; 0,4 &amp; 4,3 &amp; 6,2 &amp; 6,1 \cr
2 &amp; 0,6 &amp; 3,4 &amp; 4,2 &amp; 3,0 \cr
3 &amp; 0,6 &amp; 2,3 &amp; 2,0 &amp; 0,-3
\end{array}$$</p>

<p>Iterated elimination:</p>

<ul>
<li>Firm 1: 1 strictly dominates 0 \(\implies\) remove 0-column</li>
<li>Firm 2: 2 strictly dominates 3 \(\implies\) remove 3-row</li>
<li>Firm 1: 2 strictly dominates 1 \(\implies\) remove 1-column</li>
<li>Firm 2: 1 strictly dominates 0 \(\implies\) remove 0-row</li>
</ul>

<p>This leaves us with the following 2x2 game matrix:</p>

<p>$$\begin{array}{c|lr}
 &amp; 2 &amp; 3 \cr
\hline
1 &amp; 6,2 &amp; 6,1 \cr
2 &amp; 4,2 &amp; 3,0 \cr
\end{array}$$</p>

<p>There are 3 pure-strategy Nash equilibria, \((q_1,q_2,\pi_1,\pi_2)\):</p>

<ol>
<li>\((2,1,6,2)\)</li>
<li>\((2,2,4,2)\)</li>
<li>\((3,1,6,1)\)</li>
</ol>

<p>Letting \(p_1 = Pr(q_2=1)\), \(p_2 = Pr(q_2=2)\), \(k_2=Pr(q_1=2)\), \(k_3=Pr(q_1=3)\), we can get their expected utilities:</p>

<p>$$\begin{align}
EU_{1}(2) &amp; = p_1(6) + p_2(4) = 6p_1 + 4p_2 \cr
EU_{1}(3) &amp; = p_1(6) + p_2(3) = 6p_1 + 3p_2 \cr
EU_{2}(1) &amp; = k_2(2) + k_3(1) = 2k_2 + k_3 \cr
EU_{2}(2) &amp; = k_2(2) + k_3(0) = 2k_2 \cr
\end{align}$$</p>

<p>By applying expected-utility indifference, we can construct a mixed NE.</p>

<p>$$\begin{align}
EU_1(2) &amp; = EU_1(3) \cr
EU_2(1) &amp; = EU_2(2) \cr
\implies p_2&amp;=0,p_1=1 \cr
 k_3&amp;=0,k_2=1 \cr 
\end{align}$$</p>

<p>This is odd: The mixed NE that&#39;s coming out is a degenerate one, pure NE #1. I think I remember something to the effect that the total number of pure + mixed NE in a matrix game is supposed to be odd, so this might imply that there are actually no mixed NE? I was told that this game actually has infinitely many mixed NE, but I don&#39;t see it.</p>
