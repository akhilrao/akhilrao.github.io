Hi there! I'm an PhD student studying economics. I use this blog to think about models and theorems I study.

Right now, I'm doing "a model a day" - every day (or as often as possible), I blog about an economic model or theorem. If you spot an error, please let me know at akhilrao72 [at] gmail [dot] com.

Hope you enjoy!
