Under construction.


Hi there! I'm an PhD student studying economics. I use this blog to write out ideas at various stages of development. It helps me to have a place to play with and store them. Most of these ideas are economics-related, but not all of them.


Most of these ideas are not new. Some them may show up as standard questions in graduate economic theory classes. Some of them are ideas from papers other people wrote that I wanted to work through. Some are thoughts I had that other people have probably done before, probably better. I won't cite things unless I'm going through a paper.


Right now, I'm trying to do "a model a day" - every day, I'll post a different economic model with a solution, some steps, and some intuition. Hence the title of this blog (it will change eventually). Blogging about the models is a commitment device to keep me from slacking off.


Hope you enjoy!
