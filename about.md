## me
I'm a 3rd year PhD student in Economics at the University of Colorado, Boulder. I'm broadly interested in microeconomics and econometrics, particularly resource use and high-dimensional modeling. My current research is focused on the economics of Earth's orbits and trading in Australian water markets.

This blog started as a commitment device for studying, and has become a place for me to think out loud about things that interest me. If you spot an error, please let me know at akhilrao72 [at] gmail [dot] com.
