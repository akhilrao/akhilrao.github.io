### who are you?

I am a PhD candidate in the
[Department of Economics](https://www.colorado.edu/Economics/)
at the University of Colorado Boulder. My research is
in environmental, natural resource, and computational economics. I am on the job market in 2018-2019 and available for interviews at the ASSA annual meeting in Atlanta.

I received a BS in [Business Administration](https://soba.ucr.edu/)
in 2012 from the
University of California&ndash;Riverside, and an
MA in Economics in 2016 from the
University of Colorado&ndash;Boulder; my PhD adviser is
[Dan Kaffine](http://spot.colorado.edu/~daka9342/).

### what do you do?

I study common-pool resources and commercial orbit use. Earth's orbits are the world's largest common-pool resource. As humans launch more satellites, the risk of collisions between orbiting objects increases. Paths in low-Earth orbit are under &ldquo;open access&rdquo; - firms are unable to secure property rights over orbits. Open access to a common-pool resource typically causes over-exploitation, and sometimes collapse, of the resource. In the orbital case, expect to see more catastrophic collisions and a higher risk of [Kessler Syndrome](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kessler_syndrome) in low-Earth orbit than would be socially optimal.

My job market paper looks at how commercial orbit use should be regulated and the extent to which active debris removal technologies can bring about socially optimal orbit use. I find that despite physical uncertainty, orbit use policies can be efficient as prices or quantities because the uncertainty is symmetric between regulators and firms. The key distinction for policy design is whether policies are imposed on satellite launches or satellite ownership. Policies targeting satellite launches act as entry-deterrents, creating rents for incumbent satellite owners and causing suboptimal spikes in the launch rate and catastrophic collision risk. Policies targeting satellite ownership can smoothly reduce the catastrophic collision risk and induce deorbits when necessary. Though active debris removal technologies can reduce the risk of Kessler Syndrome, they will only reduce the risk of catastrophic collisions to the extent that satellite owners bear the cost of debris removal.

Lately I've been working on applying tools from [information elicitation](https://sites.google.com/site/informationelicitation/) to externality problems in environmental economics. I'm most interested in the limits of externality-correcting mechanism design when regulators have to ask firms for information (or trust that firms won't game the measurements) in order to assess compliance and liability. The Volkswagen emissions scandal is one of the higher-profile cases in recent memory where the assumption of "no strategic behavior" broke down. <!--, with [nontrivial public health consequences](http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/1748-9326/aa5987).-->

In my free time I make [silly Twitter bots](https://twitter.com/bakRabot), play video games (online RTS and single-player RPGs), and think about the economics of fictional worlds.
