### who are you?

I am a PhD candidate in the
[Department of Economics](https://www.colorado.edu/Economics/)
at the University of Colorado&ndash;Boulder. My research is in
in environmental, natural resource, and computational economics.

I received a BS in [Business Administration](https://soba.ucr.edu/)
in 2012 from the
University of California&ndash;Riverside, and an
MA in [Economics](https://www.colorado.edu/Economics/) in 2016 from the
University of Colorado&ndash;Boulder; my PhD advisor is
[Dan Kaffine](http://spot.colorado.edu/~daka9342/).

### what do you do?

For the last few years, I've studied common-pool resources and commercial orbit use. Earth's orbits are the world's largest common-pool resource. As humans launches more satellites, the risk of collisions between orbiting objects increases. Paths in low-Earth orbit are under &ldquo;open access&rdquo; - though radio spectrum in those regions is licensed, firms are unable to secure property rights over orbital locations. Open access to a commons typically results in over-exploitation, and sometimes collapse, of the resource. In the orbital case, expect to see more catastrophic collisions and a higher risk of [Kessler Syndrome](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kessler_syndrome) in low-Earth orbit than would be socially optimal.

Day to day, I write theoretical economic models and prove that they possess certain properties or compute them. Sometimes both. Sometimes I use data to compute things, with or without a theoretical model. My favorite computations tell a story and lend themselves to cool pictures. In my free time, I create [ridiculous Twitter bots](https://twitter.com/bakRabot), play video games (usually online RTS games and single-player RPGs), and think about the economics of fictional worlds.
