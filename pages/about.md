### who are you?

I am a PhD candidate in the
[Department of Economics](https://www.colorado.edu/Economics/)
at the University of Colorado&ndash;Boulder. My research is
in environmental, natural resource, and computational economics.

I received a BS in [Business Administration](https://soba.ucr.edu/)
in 2012 from the
University of California&ndash;Riverside, and an
MA in [Economics](https://www.colorado.edu/Economics/) in 2016 from the
University of Colorado&ndash;Boulder; my PhD advisor is
[Dan Kaffine](http://spot.colorado.edu/~daka9342/).

### what do you do?

For the last few years, I've studied common-pool resources and commercial orbit use. Earth's orbits are the world's largest common-pool resource. As humans launch more satellites, the risk of collisions between orbiting objects increases. Paths in low-Earth orbit are under &ldquo;open access&rdquo; - firms are unable to secure property rights over orbital locations (though radio spectrum in those regions is licensed). Open access to a commons typically results in over-exploitation, and sometimes collapse, of the resource. In the orbital case, expect to see more catastrophic collisions and a higher risk of [Kessler Syndrome](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kessler_syndrome) in low-Earth orbit than would be socially optimal.

Lately I've been working on applying tools from algorithmic economics, particularly [information elicitation](https://sites.google.com/site/informationelicitation/), to externality problems in environmental economics. I'm most interested in the limits of externality-correcting mechanism design when regulators have to ask firms for information (or trust that firms won't game the measurements) in order to assess compliance and liability. The Volkswagen emissions scandal is one of the higher-profile cases in recent memory where the assumption of "no strategic behavior" broke down, with [nontrivial public health consequences](http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/1748-9326/aa5987).

In my free time I make [silly Twitter bots](https://twitter.com/bakRabot), play video games (online RTS and single-player RPGs), and think about the economics of fictional worlds.
