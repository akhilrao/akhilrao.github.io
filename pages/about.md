### who are you?

I am an Assistant Professor of Economics at Middlebury College, working mostly on outer space-related issues.

I received a BS in [Business Administration](https://soba.ucr.edu/)
in 2012 from the
University of California, Riverside, and an
MA in Economics in 2016 from the
University of Colorado Boulder; my PhD adviser was
[Dan Kaffine](http://spot.colorado.edu/~daka9342/). Before graduate school, I worked on motion sensor data analysis for action sports.

### what do you do?

My research is in three agendas: first, the economics of outer space; second, computational economics; third, the economics of scientific investments. Most of my research is motivated by a desire to see us (humans) make better use our limited resources and fragile environments.

#### the economics of outer space

The bulk of my research is on the economics of orbit use. Earth's orbits are the world's largest common-pool resource. As humans launch more satellites, the risk of collisions between orbiting objects increases. Paths in low-Earth orbit are under &ldquo;open access&rdquo; - firms are unable to secure property rights over orbits. Open access to a common-pool resource typically causes over-exploitation, and sometimes collapse, of the resource. In the orbital case, expect to see more satellite-destroying collisions and a higher risk of [Kessler Syndrome](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kessler_syndrome) in low-Earth orbit than would be socially optimal.

In my job market paper I derive economic principles governing the choice of space traffic control policies and the effects of active debris removal technologies. Since physical uncertainty over collisions is symmetric between regulators and firms, space traffic control policies can be efficient as prices or quantities. What matters for efficiency is whether policies are imposed on the stock of active satellites in an orbit (e.g. a satellite tax) or the flow of satellites entering an orbit (e.g. a launch tax). Policies targeting satellite launches deter entry into the orbital commons, creating rents for incumbent satellite owners. These rents cause inefficient spikes in the launch rate, collision risk, and risk of Kessler Syndrome, and limit the regulator's ability to induce socially but not privately optimal satellite deorbits. Policies targeting satellite ownership, on the other hand, can smoothly reduce the collision risk and induce deorbits when necessary. Though active debris removal technologies can reduce the risk of Kessler Syndrome, under open access they will only reduce the risk of satellite-destroying collisions to the extent that satellite owners bear the cost of debris removal.

While my research so far has focused on commercial orbit use, these topics are closely connected to questions of national security and conflict in space. I am interested in pursuing those connections in the future.

#### computational economics

My interest in computational economics encompasses computational modeling of economic systems and assessing the economic policy consequences of computational tools and limitations. 

My work in computational modeling has primarily focused on ways to speed up dynamic programming algorithms and efficient methods to simulate agent-based models of rational expectations equilibria and Arrow-Debreu markets. Agent-based simulations are particularly interesting to me in that their limitations often suggest practical limitations which real humans and organizations need to work around, and allow researchers to assess the computational credibility of specific equilibrium concepts and policy instruments.

I am also interested in applying tools from [information elicitation](https://sites.google.com/site/informationelicitation/) to externality problems in environmental economics. Many of these problems require a regulator to elicit reports from parties generating externalities to assess compliance and liability. Using these reports as the basis of corrective policy gives externality creators an incentive to manipulate their reports to reduce their liability. In ongoing work, my coauthor and I uncover some features of economically-efficient elicitation and corrective taxation mechanisms which use independently-obtained aggregate or ambient data to verify marginal emissions reports from polluters. We numerically analyze a specific scheme, the Brier-Pigou tax, and consider its robustness to strategic collusion in reporting. I think it would be useful for policy design if this could be generalized to an understanding of how the [elicitation complexity](https://arxiv.org/abs/1506.07212) of marginal damages or abatements scales with uncertainty and convexity in the damage or abatement cost functions. This research agenda connects to broader questions about the policy design implications of information requirements and bounded computational abilities.

#### the economics of scientific investments

This is a relatively new agenda for me and one I'm very excited about. The broad question I'm considering is, "How should society prioritize resources among investments in scientific progress?" Specifically, I'm working on the economics of investments in particle colliders for high-energy physics.

<!-- The Volkswagen emissions scandal is one of the higher-profile cases in recent memory where the assumption of "no strategic behavior" broke down., with [nontrivial public health consequences](http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/1748-9326/aa5987).--> <!-- A related issue I'm interested in is the  of marginal damages or abatements, given some restrictions on the damage or abatement cost functions. Knowing the limits of truthful elicitation in settings with externalities can help policy makers anticipate policy instrument failure modes. Knowing how the elicitation complexity of (for example) marginal abatements scales with the convexity of the abatement cost function can help policy makers design better instruments to elicit marginal abatements. -->


### what are some non-researchy things you're into?

In my free time I make [silly Twitter bots](https://twitter.com/bakRabot), play video games (online RTS and single-player RPGs), and think about the economics of fictional worlds. I take care of a cat who thinks I'm kind of slow, and some plants who think the cat doesn't understand "no". <!-- [e.g. [1](https://akhilrao.github.io/blog/micro%20theory/2018/06/05/zero-dawn-economy/),[2](https://akhilrao.github.io/blog/micro%20theory/2016/08/15/dark-forest-simple-model/)] -->.
