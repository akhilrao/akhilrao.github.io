### what is your work about?

Pedagogically, I'm very interested in the use of games and experiential learning to teach mathematical and economic concepts.

My research is mostly about the environmental and industrial economics of outer space, with a second agenda about environmental disasters featuring strong biophysical couplings with economic activity (e.g. infectious disease, fires). There is usually a computational or dynamic flavor in my work. My research is motivated by a desire to see us make better use of limited resources and fragile environments.

#### the economics of space sustainability

Most of my research is on the economics of orbit use (much of which is increasingly under the term "space sustainability"). Earth's orbits are the world's largest common-pool resource, and as humans launch more satellites the risk of collisions between orbiting objects increases. Paths in low-Earth orbit are under &ldquo;open access&rdquo;&mdash;firms are unable to secure property rights over orbits. Open access to a common-pool resource typically causes over-exploitation, and sometimes collapse, of the resource. In the orbital case, expect to see more satellite-destroying collisions and a higher risk of [Kessler Syndrome](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kessler_syndrome) in low-Earth orbit than would be socially optimal.

In my job market paper I derived economic principles governing the choice of space traffic control policies and the effects of active debris removal technologies. Since physical uncertainty over collisions is symmetric between regulators and firms, space traffic control policies can be efficient as prices or quantities. What matters for efficiency is whether policies are imposed on the stock of active satellites in an orbit (e.g. a satellite tax) or the flow of satellites entering an orbit (e.g. a launch tax). Policies targeting satellite launches deter entry into the orbital commons, creating rents for incumbent satellite owners. These rents cause inefficient spikes in the launch rate, collision risk, and risk of Kessler Syndrome, and limit the regulator's ability to induce socially but not privately optimal satellite deorbits. Policies targeting satellite ownership, on the other hand, can smoothly reduce the collision risk and induce deorbits when necessary. Though active debris removal technologies can reduce the risk of Kessler Syndrome, under open access they will only reduce the risk of satellite-destroying collisions to the extent that satellite owners bear the cost of debris removal.

Other work in this area: I'm looking into how megaconstellation owners will interact and how they should be regulated; designing integrated assessment models of orbit use which combine structural econometric methods and tractable physics models of orbital mechanics; using network theory and econometrics to develop granular models of risk-mitigating maneuvering patterns in orbit; and the structure of self-enforcing international agreements to manage collision risk and debris production. These projects involve a mix of economic theory and statistics. Calibrating/estimating the models requires substantial new data collection and integration.

While I focus on commercial orbit use, national security space use is an important piece of the story. Historically, the most accurate space situational awareness data has been provided by the US military as a global public good, and the US national security establishment has been one of the largest space users globally. This is changing now as commercial use takes off and other nations are also starting to demonstrate [anti-satellite weapons](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anti-satellite_weapon) capabilities. The latter is particularly dangerous for orbit management, as a kinetic conflict in space could trigger Kessler Syndrome in valuable orbits. It's still unclear to me how effective orbit management policy should account for this.

#### other work

I have some other research projects. To the extent there's a theme they're environmental or space economics topics with a macroeconomic or computational aspect. Projects in this area include: [modeling disease-economy trade-offs under different control strategies](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-022-30642-8); estimating the dynamic effects of fires on county-level employment in the US; and studying how risk preferences and altruism respond to natural disasters.

#### the economics of scientific investments

The broad question I'm considering is, "How should society prioritize resources among investments in scientific progress?"  While cost-benefit analysis is the guiding principle, there are significant challenges in calculating the benefits of scientific investments, many of which involve fundamental limits of human knowledge and significant lags in realizing benefits. It is difficult to assign probabilities to outcomes we can't conceive of, and it may take many decades before we realize the value of a contribution. I often think of the Fourier transform in this context: [though it was known since at least around 1823, it wasn't until 1930 that Norbert Wiener demonstrated the broad utility of the equation](https://pulse.embs.org/january-2016/highlights-in-the-history-of-the-fourier-transform/). In this context, I wonder under what assumptions cost-benefit analyses of supporting the mathematicians developing these tools would have declared their work beneficial enough to publicly support.

Currently I'm thinking about the economics of investments in particle colliders for high-energy physics. One of the central aims of particle physics is to understand the elementary building blocks of nature. The consensus in the particle physics community seems to be that larger particle colliders are necessary to select between different high-energy theories.

While the costs of collider investments are often relatively easy to measure, their benefits are varied and relatively difficult to measure. They span direct and indirect benefits received by regional economies, including scientific workforces and those who would employ them later, benefits conferred from spinoff technologies (some which are predictable and some which are less so), national security benefits of maintaining a buffer of skilled scientists and engineers, and the direct scientific benefits of the work itself. My goal here as an economist is to frame the ongoing debate about collider investments in the US in rigorous economic terms, provide best practices for conducting cost-benefit analyses for new collider investments around the world, and develop policy guidelines to maximize the net benefits of such investments. -->


### what is your play about?

I like bike rides, snowboarding, and sci-fi/fantasy and historical fiction. I live with cats who think I'm kind of slow.
