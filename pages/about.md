### what is your work about?

Pedagogically, I'm very interested in the use of games and experiential learning to teach mathematical and economic concepts.

My research is mostly about the environmental and industrial economics of outer space, with a second agenda about environmental disasters featuring strong biophysical couplings with economic activity (e.g. infectious disease, fires). There is usually a computational or dynamic flavor in my work. My research is motivated by a desire to see us make better use of limited resources and fragile environments.

#### academic research

Most of my research is about the economics of orbit use, much of which fits under the increasingly-popular term ["space sustainability"](https://www.nasa.gov/spacesustainability/). Earth's orbits are the world's largest common-pool resource, and as humans launch more satellites the risk of collisions between orbiting objects increases. Paths in low-Earth orbit are under &ldquo;open access&rdquo;&mdash;firms are unable to secure property rights over orbits. Open access to a common-pool resource typically causes over-exploitation, and sometimes collapse, of the resource. In the orbital case, expect to see more satellite-destroying collisions and a higher risk of [Kessler Syndrome](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kessler_syndrome) in low-Earth orbit than would be socially optimal. 

Some of my work on orbit use: [measuring the gains from optimal orbital-use management through Pigouvian taxation](https://www.pnas.org/doi/10.1073/pnas.1921260117); [developing resource economic theory for open-access vs optimal orbit use and assessing conditions under which Kessler Syndrome is an equilibrium or even optimal outcome](https://arxiv.org/abs/2202.07442); studying economic policy choice and the equilibrium deployment of active debris removal technologies; [studying how megaconstellation operators will interact and how they should be regulated](https://www.pnas.org/doi/10.1073/pnas.2221343120); [designing integrated assessment models of orbit use](https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.10252); [using network theory and econometrics to develop granular models of risk-mitigating maneuvering patterns in orbit](https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.04599); [assessing the terrestrial sustainbility impacts of megaconstellations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.02338); and [analyzing the structure of self-enforcing international agreements to manage collision risk and debris production](https://arxiv.org/abs/2205.03926). These projects involve a mix of economic theory and statistics. Calibrating/estimating the models tends to require substantial new data collection and integration.

Not all of my academic research is about outer space. My other projects tend to be about environmental economics topics, sometimes with a macroeconomic dimension. Projects in this area include: [modeling disease-economy trade-offs under different control strategies](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-022-30642-8); [estimating the dynamic effects of fires on county-level employment in the US](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0095069624001839); and studying how risk preferences and altruism change after natural disasters.

#### the economics of scientific investments

The broad question I'm considering is, "How should society prioritize resources among investments in scientific progress?"  While cost-benefit analysis is the guiding principle, there are significant challenges in calculating the benefits of scientific investments, many of which involve fundamental limits of human knowledge and significant lags in realizing benefits. It is difficult to assign probabilities to outcomes we can't conceive of, and it may take many decades before we realize the value of a contribution. I often think of the Fourier transform in this context: [though it was known since at least around 1823, it wasn't until 1930 that Norbert Wiener demonstrated the broad utility of the equation](https://pulse.embs.org/january-2016/highlights-in-the-history-of-the-fourier-transform/). In this context, I wonder under what assumptions cost-benefit analyses of supporting the mathematicians developing these tools would have declared their work beneficial enough to publicly support.

Currently I'm thinking about the economics of investments in particle colliders for high-energy physics. One of the central aims of particle physics is to understand the elementary building blocks of nature. The consensus in the particle physics community seems to be that larger particle colliders are necessary to select between different high-energy theories.

While the costs of collider investments are often relatively easy to measure, their benefits are varied and relatively difficult to measure. They span direct and indirect benefits received by regional economies, including scientific workforces and those who would employ them later, benefits conferred from spinoff technologies (some which are predictable and some which are less so), national security benefits of maintaining a buffer of skilled scientists and engineers, and the direct scientific benefits of the work itself. My goal here as an economist is to frame the ongoing debate about collider investments in the US in rigorous economic terms, provide best practices for conducting cost-benefit analyses for new collider investments around the world, and develop policy guidelines to maximize the net benefits of such investments. -->


### what is your play about?

I like bike rides, snowboarding, and sci-fi/fantasy and historical fiction. I live with cats who think I'm kind of slow.
