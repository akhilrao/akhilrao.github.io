![A History of Falcon Booster Reuse](../../assets/bigpublpics/falcon-reuse.jpg)

**How many times has SpaceX reused Falcon boosters?** &mdash; The picture plots the number of times each Falcon booster has flown, whether on a Falcon 9 (solo) or a Falcon Heavy (as one of three), using [2023 data from Jonathan McDowell's General Catalog of Artificial Space Objects](https://planet4589.org/space/gcat/). By late 2023, 4 boosters had flown 19 times and the median booster had flown 12 times.
