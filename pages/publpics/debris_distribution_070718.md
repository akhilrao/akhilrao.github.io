**Where are debris located?** &mdash; The figure shows the locations of debris in low-Earth orbit. Panel a shows the [apogee and perigee](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apsis) against the [orbital period](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orbital_period) for all tracked debris orbiting the Earth, using [July 07 2018 data from the Joint Space Operations Center](https://www.space-track.org). Panels b, c, and d show histograms of debris over mean altitude, eccentricity, and inclination.

The plot shown in panel a is a "Gabbard diagrams", which are used to visualize the distribution of debris after fragmentation events (e.g. [1](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_debris#/media/File:Gabbard_diagram.png), [2](https://www.orbitaldebris.jsc.nasa.gov/library/satellitefraghistory/13theditionofbreakupbook.pdf)). Clusters of points indicate objects with similar altitudes and velocities around the Earth.
