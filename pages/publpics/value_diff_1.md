![The gains from optimal launch control](../../assets/bigpublpics/value_diff_1.png)

**Figure 4**. &mdash; The difference between fleet value functions under a social planner and pure open access. A social planner would launch fewer satellites per period, and would stop launching sooner in response to accumulating satellites and debris. This creates a non-monotonicity in the difference between the two value functions, which is maximized when the social planner would stop launching but open-access firms would continue launching. Regulation or cooperation would increase the value society derives from satellites as long as we are not where even open-access firms would not want to launch.
