Akhil Rao, Matthew Burgess, Daniel Kaffine: *Orbital-use fees could more than quadruple the value of the space industry* (forthcoming, *Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences*) [SI Appendix](../../assets/working_papers/OUF_SI_PNAS.pdf)

		<b>Abstract:</b> The space industryâ€™s rapid recent growth represents the latest Tragedy of the Commons. Satellites launched into orbit contribute to&mdash;and risk damage from&mdash;a growing  buildup of space debris and other satellites. Collision risk from this orbital congestion is costly to satellite operators. Technological and managerial solutions&mdash;such as active debris removal or end-of-life satellite deorbit guidelines&mdash;are currently being explored by regulatory authorities. However, none of these approaches address the underlying incentive problem: satellite operators do not account for costs they impose on each other via collision risk. Here, we show an internationally harmonized orbital-use fee can correct these incentives and substantially increase the value of the space industry. We construct and analyze a coupled physical-economic model of commercial launches and debris accumulation in low-Earth orbit. Similar to carbon taxes, our model projects an optimal fee that rises at a rate of 14% per year, equal to roughly $235,000 per satellite-year in 2040. The long-run value of the satellite industry would more than quadruple by 2040&mdash;increasing from around $600 billion under business-as-usual to around $3 trillion. In contrast, we project  purely technological solutions are unlikely to fully address the problem of orbital congestion. Indeed, we find debris removal sometimes worsens economic damages from congestion by increasing launch incentives. In other sectors, addressing the Tragedy of the Commons has often been a game of catch-up with substantial social costs. The infant space industry can avert these costs before they escalate.

Akhil Rao: *Economic Principles of Space Traffic Control* (job market paper) [draft](../../assets/working_papers/Economic_Principles_of_Space_Traffic_Control.pdf)

		<b>Abstract:</b> Open access to Earth's orbits presents a unique regulatory challenge. In this paper, I derive economic principles governing the choice of space traffic control policies. I show that policies which target satellite ownership, such as satellite taxes or permits, achieve greater expected social welfare than policies which target satellite launches, such as launch taxes or permits. Price or quantity policies can achieve equal expected social welfare due to the symmetry of uncertainty between regulators and firms. I also show that active debris removal can reduce the risk of runaway debris growth no matter how it is financed, but can only reduce the risk of satellite-destroying collisions if satellite owners pay for it or if competition from removal--induced entry reduces the returns to satellite ownership. Technical solutions to space traffic control tend to emphasize launch restrictions or public funding of debris removal technology development and use, but often ignore that current and prospective orbit users dissipate rents under open access. While satellite-focused policies can achieve first-best orbit use, attempts to control orbital debris growth and collision risk through launch fees or debris removal subsidies under open access may be ineffective or backfire.

Akhil Rao, Giacomo Rondina: *Cost in Space: Debris and Collision Risk in the Orbital Commons* [draft](../../assets/working_papers/Cost_in_Space.pdf)

		<b>Abstract:</b> As Earth's orbital space fills with satellites and debris, debris-producing collisions between orbiting bodies become more likely. Runaway debris growth, known as Kessler Syndrome, may render Earth's orbits unusable for millennia. We present the first dynamic physico-economic model of Earth orbit use under rational expectations with endogenous collision risk and Kessler Syndrome. As long as satellites can be destroyed in collisions with debris and other satellites, there is a continuum of open-access equilibria determined by the excess return on a satellite. Under reasonable physical assumptions, all are inefficient. When autocatalytic debris production is possible this continuum allows for multiple steady states, which can be destabilized by increases in the excess return on a satellite. Further, open-access launch rate paths are likely to overshoot steady states. Overshooting can cause short-run rebound effects when physical or economic parameters change, for example when environmental processes increase the debris decay rate or the costs of launching a satellite decrease. Kessler Syndrome is inefficient, and open access is increasingly likely to cause it as the excess return on a satellite increases.

Akhil Rao, Brennan McConnell: *Elicitation and Corrective Taxation* (mimeo) <!--[draft](../../assets/working_papers/Elicitation_and_Corrective_Taxation.pdf)-->

		<b>Abstract:</b> Marginal contributions to observable aggregate stocks are often unobservable in games with negative stock externalities, making optimal corrective taxation a difficult endeavor. We propose a new class of mechanism, the <i>elicited tax</i>, for such settings. The elicited tax uses an observable aggregate measure to elicit private information about marginal contributions, and a scored tax to penalize reports which are inconsistent with the observable aggregate and other reports. In this paper, we define a notion of strict propriety for elicited taxes, show that under perfect competition reports are Nash equilibria if and only if they are consistent with the observable aggregate, and that strictly proper elicited taxes ensure socially optimal output and externality production. We then study a particular strictly proper elicited tax, the <i>Brier-Pigou</i> tax, which combines a modified Brier scoring rule with a Pigouvian tax. Numerical experiments highlight three properties of the Brier-Pigou tax: (1) the tax can maximize social welfare when firms are perfectly competitive; (2) the tax achieves close to optimal welfare even when firms are perfectly collusive reporters; and (3) the proportion of consistent lies which are risk-dominated by truthful reporting for each firm depends on the number of firms providing reports and that firm's true marginal externality, suggesting conditions under which truthful reporting equilibria will be selected.
