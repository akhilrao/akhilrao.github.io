summary: A firm's profit is a random variable. A manager can exert effort to influence it, and has private information about the cost of doing so. An equilibrium is described given some conditions on the conditional density of profit and the manager's utility from effort.

This problem is similar to the earlier [principal-agent problem](http://akhilrao.github.io/micro%20theory/2015/10/15/principal-agent-problem-owner-manager/). Instead of the manager's choice of effort being hidden, it's the cost to the manager of exerting effort that is hidden.

Assume that profit is a random variable that can be influenced by the manager's effort, \\( \pi(e) \\) such that \\( \pi'(e) \gt 0 ,  \pi''(e) \lt 0 \\). The manager's utility is given by \\( u(w,e,\theta ) = v(w-g(e,\theta)) \\). The manager's disutility from effort satisfies \\( g(0,\theta) = 0 ~ \forall \theta \\) and is 

\\( \theta \in \\{\theta_l , \theta_h

$$\begin{align}
g(x) = \begin{cases}
1 : |x| \le 1 \cr
0 : |x| > 1 \cr
\end{cases}
\end{align}$$
