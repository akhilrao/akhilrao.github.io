Trash in space is an interesting externality problem. Another layer can be added by considering strategic military action that would reduce trash - space wars. But forget space wars for now, let's just think about space trash. There's stuff in the 10/10/2015 notebook about trash and conflict. Basically a prisoner's dilemma with trash accumulation.

Trash in space is an interesting externality problem. Everyone benefits from a clear near-earth orbit that allows for lots of satellites (e.g. comm sats) and travel paths. Dumping stuff in space is common because
 
(a) there are no property rights over chunks of space (public/common good problem for near-earth orbit, depending on how you look at excludability over specific orbits)
(b) Trash in space will burn up harmlessly with some probability (depends on size/composition of object, more likely over time)

(a) causes a market failure no matter what. Attempts to enforce property rights are complicated by the fact that debris drifts through space - something dumped over china may end up occupying a complex orbit that impacts american launches. Attempts to define property rights are complicated by the nature and utility of geostationary orbits.

(b) is interesting because it can add some imperfect information and enforcement dynamics. But it also ensures that the optimal level of trash dumping in space is positive, since it's literally free disposal.

Complicating factors:

The market failure in (a) is complicated by the stochastic drift and orbiting behavior of objects in space, plus collisions. This is the kind of thing I'd bet statistical mechanics has figured out pretty well, and that I could be well-prepared to model with some work in stochastic processes and differential equations. I can do some rough first-order approximating with assumptions to begin with - drift lets me say the problem is global (maybe with some exogenous probability), and then I think I can use collision to justify the decreasing probability of any piece of trash surviving over time when I do dynamics.

The agents:

Two basic types of agents: spacefaring nations and non-spacefaring nations. Each is trying to maximize utility, and each gets utility (public good) from spacefaring nations' investment in comm sats (example I'll start with for now). However, commsats generate trash, and this causes problems. How should trash reduction be priced? How should trash be reduced? Can non-spacefaring nations bargain? Can spacefaring nations cartelize?

Try a basic version with just two agents, one period, something super basic.

Then try adding two periods and a simple law of motion for trash.

Then try extending periods.

All throughout - what is the CE outcome? What is the planner's outcome? What is the PoA/PoS?

Dynamics: are there cooperative or transgressive possibilities that can increase any payoffs?

Then try changing number of each type of nations. How does each type react to the change in each others' numbers?
