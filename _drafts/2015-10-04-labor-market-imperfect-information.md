summary: An example of a simple labor market with imperfect information.
---

Suppose there is a single firm facing a perfectly competitive labor market. A potential employee \\(E\\)'s productivity to the firm is the realization of a random variable \\(\theta \sim U[0,2]\\). \\(E\\)'s reservation wage is \\(r(\theta)=\theta^2\\). (I prefer to think of the reservation wage as \\(E\\)'s home production ability here.)

What does the competitive equilibrium look like?

#### Benchmark case: \\(\theta\\) is public information

When \\(\theta\\) is public information, the firm will pay each worker their marginal productivity, \\(w=\theta\\).
