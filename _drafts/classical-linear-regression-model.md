Say you have some observations of random variables who are related to each other, a sequence \\(\{(Y_t,X_{t1},...,X_{tD})\}_{t=1}^n\\). The Classical Linear Regression Model (CLRM) is one way to go about constructing a statistical model of the relationships between the variables. The CLRM forms the basis of many econometric models.

There are two fundamental assumptions that define the CLRM.

##### Assumption 1

$$\begin{pmatrix}
\left( Y_t \cr X_t \right)
\end{pmatrix}$$
