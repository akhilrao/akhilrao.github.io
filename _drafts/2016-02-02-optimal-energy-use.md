### The Space Board

The "space board" is the hypothetical entity that would enforce the centralized "optimal satellite plan".

Let \\( E(t)\\) be the number of satellites in orbit at a given instant in time, and \\( C(E(t)) \\) be the consumer's instantaneous consumption of satellite services (I'm assuming the technology that transforms satellites into satellite services is linear to simplify things). The stock of debris in orbit is given by \\(P\\), and \\(S\\) be the amount of usable orbital area. \\( \dot{P} \\), \\( \dot{S} \\), and \\( \dot{E} \\) denote the time derivatives of debris, usable space, and satellites respectively.
