I recently read that [Netflix is having some issues with VPNs.](http://www.wired.com/2016/03/netflix-discontent-blocked-vpns-boiling/). As someone who loads up Netflix probably at least once a day on average, I can understand the customer outrage. You come home after a long day to enjoy this new show your buddy was talking about... and Netflix won't serve it to you! You can see that Netflix offers it, but they just won't show it to you because you're in the wrong country or some such nonsense. It's enough to make a person want to pirate some content.

This got me thinking about a model I wrote for a class some time ago. With a little work, I think we can retool it to help us think about Netflix's VPN situation.
